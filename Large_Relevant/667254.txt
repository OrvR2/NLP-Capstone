Lol at poor Michael, people were so mean﻿ to him.. What about the children he was mean too.. Yes he made some good music.. but that good music shudn't take away the fact that he was a major fucking weirdo away from his music... no smoke without fire :)

He could have stood there doing nothing the full 12 minutes and the audience would have gone just as crazy! :) When the images of the children were lifted by the﻿ audience across the stadium, it was one of the coolest, most heartfelt moments for me. God bless you, R.I.P. Michael.

Thanks Michael for all those amazing songs that you created!...thanks for all your charity work..I think you went directly to heaven! because﻿ when one dies one does not take the bank accounts or cars but what we did for others and I know he helped a lot of people with his charity...other things are just gossip..He was a true artist..! Michael forever.

For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

I must have written dozens of posts about Michael this past few days celebrating the 30th anniversary of thriller. I guess I wanna say that I am not sad anymore for Michael. He is in a better place now. He was truly one of Gods miracles that made this planet much happier, and this world did not even reciprocate his kindness. I am sad for all of us who will﻿ never in this lifetime or the next experience an artist like this. But thankful for all the music he left behind that will live on.

Really even though he was lip syncing he already proved he can sing live. You should go look up some of his live performances especially in victory era. Actually i don't know why he lip synced as much as he did cause i find he﻿ does better when he actually does sing live

Actually I don't feel cheated since like i said earlier ive seen Michael perform and knows he can actually sing live. Think though; id be kinda hard in this setting to be live and hear him. Also hes not overrated since Michael is an actual all around performer he can make up the lip syncing with his dance. Not like bieber or Britney who cant sing live or dance and still lip sync for no logical reason, At least when MJ﻿ lip synced he still entertained tremendously with his dance

Who cares about those stupid polls? Michael will always be behind in all the views and everything cause they did not have facebook, twitter or utube during when Michael started singing or he would have had billions and billions of views and everything. But Michael does have the most videos on utube, so that is something! And also there will never be anyone to﻿ take his place. He will always be the King of Pop!!!

Michael Jackson was a child prodigy and changed the world, shaped the world, attempted to heal the world, gave his heart & soul to the earth and will still play on the radio and in peoples hearts 100 years from now. MJ fans are real and organic, we dont need a pole for him to be famous, leave those silly﻿ transparent poles to the beiber and gaga crowd, they need it... because will never be Michael Jackson. :)

A truly wonderful performance!!!! I'm a new fan and have just started to seek out more about Michael Jackson. I'm really sad that I found him after his death. Even today, I don't think anyone has produced the same level of excitement like he did. And this was decades ago. BTW, I'm fifteen and I know a great number of friends who are fans. I'm amazed that it﻿ goes beyond generations.

It is so sad that we live in a world so materialistic and shallow that because of a mans talent they are willing to over look the darkness he committed on innocent children. Go to- la toya jackson tel aviv 1993 - This is his own sister﻿ confessing with a broken heart her brothers sick minded crimes. Michael was so guilty that he quickly ended it all by giving his 1993 accuser 20 Million dollars to escape conviction. No amount of music or talent accuses sexual abuse﻿ on children.

Disgusting human being? ... Ah yes because you've known Michael personally for many years and so can make such a drastic judgement... Look, don't fool yourself. People make up crap about other people all the time, and﻿ the evidence in those two cases clearly pointed to his innocence. But if you choose to ignore or assume, then well, it's your loss.. got nothing against ya...just keep on trolling lol

No, Blanket was adopted as Michaels ex wife had revealed after he died. Michael had Plastic Surgery at this point meaning his features don't match his original features.
I love Mike to death, but comaring his children to his features after the Lupus and Vitiligo had vast effect on him aint﻿ too great :)

I believe Michael Jackson live performance is better than his studio works in his albums. I regret﻿ never see him in live performance. But thx to this video.

My problem with this is there is nothing different or fresh, its just the usual Michael doing his dancing, which is great in itself, but you can see this in pretty much any performance from Michael, so apart from the children cartoons in the audience in "Heal the world, i think it was a﻿ pretty bland performance compared to Madonnas half time visual spectacular

I disagree, MJ utilized the first part of his performance to establish who he was as a performer (The King of Pop), while using the second part of his performance to bring forth his pro family/racial equality message through the lyrics he sings and through the use of the imagery (Such as the the logo of the SNCC. The SNCC were explicitly connected to﻿ the Black Panther Party). Also, we have to take into consideration that MJ was using this show to get to countries that would never see his tour.

when was the first time these accusations came about? years ago when he was still receiving royalties to his songs. Never never land was a bad mistake on his part. It costs 1million US a year just to maintain the lawn. Micheal usually release hit songs every a couple of years to make money. Then all the media bashed him into hiding. When he resurface again more accusations. Legal battle costs money too. He lived and died﻿ in Never never land. Majority of ppl thinks he still has money.

The people who claimed they only started liking him after he died are﻿ liers. The originally like him but due to bad media they had to say they hated him just to conform with the majority *media* not wanting to say what they feel as﻿ they are afraid of being out casted.

Michael has a big dream and he can do it but the media ruined him. Those people ruined him and his dream. They attack him in the worst possible way. I hope i won't see those people who wrote bad things about﻿ him,writing good things about him now.

Micheal loved childhood and for the media to portray him as a﻿ monster who would touch them, it must have destroyed him. I don't believe, for a second, he EVER did that.

BUT, it was confirmed that Michael was naked in a bed with a preteen boy. No one knows if he ever "did" anything with the boy

Michael will﻿ always be the best artist of all time who wanted the best for everyone regardless what people said about him. There will never be another artist who wanted the best for all kids. Artist today worry more about the money and not who they influence.

yea he is definitely one of the very first child super stars. Raised by﻿ abusive/obsessive father. I dont believe MJ is normal. But doubt he is a bad person. The media loves bashing people while they are down because the public loves to read about people who they admire and look up to be normal human. Having normal life crisis, go through real life problems. And we enjoy seeing other people in pain, happily thinking "thank god that is not me".

I'm not jumping on the bandwagon - in fact I still criticize the things he had done... he had done some crazy shit. However, I think most people didn't realize what they had in him until after he passed away. No matter how crazy he was and no matter what kind of fucked up shit he would do (holding﻿ an infant out a window, seriously) he was still a great entertainer. Most people forget that celebrities are people, too, and one day won't be with us any longer. I think that's the case here.

The people who﻿ claimed they only started liking him after he died are liers. The originally like him but due to bad media they had to say they hated him just to conform with the majority *media* not wanting to say what they feel as they are afraid of being out casted.

My favorite part is the last half with singing Heal The World and the unbelievable complete audience participation in raising the cards to form pictures of children of all races hand in hand...a complete circle around the stadium. This﻿ was done before all the electronic light shows of today and personally, I like Michael's performance better than all the hoopla of today's Super Bowl halftimes. Btw, this was the most watched halftime ever! Of course, it's Michael Jackson. =)

How can you not cry when you see this spectacle, and﻿ feel the love that Michael had for others. Too bad they didn't give it back, but they treated him like a pedophile. I'm a therapist, and Michael was no more a pedophile than Obama. I really loved him and I cried when he died. Only 5 people's death made me cry : a son that I lost, twin daughters that I lost as well, Ayrton Senna and Michael.

Take the time to get to know MJ through his videos, his interviews, his speeches, his humanitarianism, his worldwide fames, his meetings with presidents and kings, read his﻿ books, study his many interviews from the '70's to '09. Then you'll understand why he's the most popular, most loved, most famous person ever. Until you do this, you'll never know the greatness of the kop.

Actually, he did change his skin color. It was just because of﻿ that disease, he didn't want splotches on his skin. So instead chose to just bleach it all out.

listen the the crowds elevation when black or white starts playing lol you hear that over a mile probably lol. Despite all the crap he had during his last 5 years or so, to me he still one of the most talented all round performers. They simply arnt like this anymore because today's﻿ performers are made rather than found. Michael was start when today's performers were still learning their ABC's lol.

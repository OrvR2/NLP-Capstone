Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) has just stumbled into the find of a lifetime. Upon discovering a bullet-strewn pickup truck surrounded by the corpses of dead bodyguards, Moss uncovers two million dollars in cash and a substantial load of heroin stashed in the back of the vehicle. Later, as an enigmatic killer who determines the fate of his victims with the flip of a coin sets out in pursuit of Moss, the disillusioned Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) struggles to contain the rapidly escalating violence that seems to be consuming his once-peaceful Lone Star State town. Woody Harrelson, Javier Bardem, and Kelly MacDonald co-star in a distinctly American crime story that explores timeless biblical themes in a contemporary Southwestern setting."no country for old men","no country for old men clip","tommy lee jones","tess harper","crime thrillers",thriller,"scott rudin","ethan coen","joel coen","robert graf","mark roybal","david diliberto","disillusionment videos","family videos","innocence videos","life and death videos","loneliness videos","loss videos","morality videos","parenthood videos","house videos","kitchen videos","ed tom bell","loretta bell","movie clips",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++348834,/m/01kwsg,/m/09wqqy

It's straight﻿ out of Cormac Mccarthy's novel. Almost word for word.

(Part 2) Anton is an archonic figure, asserting his dominion over humans by trapping them in a hollow system of justice (the coin). He uses this system to destroy the characters of the novel, either through direct action or through unwitting proxies who live according to the game he's established﻿ (the Mexicans). Ed, after much reflection, briefly penetrates this farce and sees his father escaping from the corrupted world with the fires of salvation. But he soon forgets, and "wakes" once again.

Two dreams I know from my parents will reoccur for the rest of your life. First, college dreams where you miss a class all semester and show up during finals week. And dreams about﻿ your parents after they pass away.

I﻿ think the first dream relates to him losing the money and failing to bring justice to the killers of llewelyn, and his fathers disapointment in him. The second dream i think is about him and his father, stuck in a cold and unforgiving world, trying to make a fire to escape the dark and the cold

The silence and the desolate landscape of this film were so full of lingering terror and fatalistic﻿ sadness. Cormac's 'The Road' was equal or perhaps even more so. Several years after reading then seeing both novels/films I am still disquieted.

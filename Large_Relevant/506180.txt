Most countries offer the Pill over-the-counterBy Kerry Grens | Reuters – Wed, Jan 2, 2013

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Unlike women in the U.S., Canada and much of Europe, most women in the world can access the birth control pill without a prescription, according to a new study.
              As medical organizations and other groups push to ease the prescription requirements for the Pill in the U.S. and elsewhere, "we can start to use this information to... get a sense of the safety of women having access to this method where no prescription is required," said Kari White, who studies birth control at the University of Alabama in Birmingham.
              The Pill is generally considered safe, said White, who was not involved in the new work, and some studies have shown that, without a doctor's input, women can accurately screen themselves for risk factors to steer away from using the Pill if it's not appropriate for them.
              Earlier this year, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a leading group of women's doctors, endorsed the idea of making the birth control pill available without a prescription (see Reuters Health report of November 20, 2012 here: http://reut.rs/UH0Zz9).
              In a survey of government health officials, pharmaceutical companies, family planning groups, medical providers and other experts in 147 countries Dr. Daniel Grossman, of Ibis Reproductive Health in Oakland, California, and his colleagues found that women in the U.S. and 44 other countries need a prescription to get birth control pills.
              The group reported in the medical journal Contraception that while another 56 countries had laws requiring prescriptions, in practice women could access the contraception over-the-counter.
              Thirty-five countries legally allowed access to oral contraceptives over-the-counter, and 11 countries allowed over-the-counter access as long as the woman is screened to ensure that she is a good candidate.
              "The patterns we saw were interesting," said Grossman. "Higher income countries - western Europe, Australia, Japan and North America - generally require a prescription."
              Grossman told Reuters Health he couldn't explain why these patterns have emerged.
              "Perhaps in places like China and India that have pills available over-the-counter formally without a prescription might be consistent with strong national family planning programs," he speculated.
              Dr. Ward Cates, of FHI 360, a research organization in Durham, North Carolina, said the lack of a prescription requirement might also reflect a general approach to making health care more accessible in countries where it is less available.
              In some countries, "healthcare tends to be more fragmented and healthcare oversight tends to be more fragmented. Therefore the availability of products tends to percolate to outlets that tend to be more accessible to the public," said Cates, who was not part of the study.
              Grossman said it will be useful for countries looking to ease restrictions on birth control access to look to the experiences of these countries.
              "Will this information about the availability of pills being over-the-counter in other countries influence policy here? Probably not," Grossman told Reuters Health.
              "But I do think it helps to put it in perspective that this is not something revolutionary."

However, many for-profit business owners are also suing, claiming a violation of their religious beliefs. The religious lawsuits have largely stalled, as the Department of Health and Human Services tries to develop an accommodation for faith groups. However, no such offer will be made to individual business owners. And their lawsuits are yielding conflicting rulings in appeals courts around the country.

If the birth control pill were available over the counter,there is a possibility that unwanted pregnancies would decrease...hmmm...less abortions?...less teen moms on welfare?...but would drug companies and insurance companies lose money?...is there an age restriction on the purchase of condoms? The idea of over the counter birth control,that's for females,is a real puzzle...ok for males...not ok for females...hmmmmm..

As I recall from several years ago when this issue came up and birth control pills were not made available over the counter, the reasoning was that requiring a prescription was an effective way to coerce young women to go to the doctor for pap smears. I remember that was a prominent reason given, but they just didn't use the word coercion.

"Most countries offer the Pill over-the-counter"  Most countries aren't run by Bible-thumping IDIOTS!  Of course, if the Pill was over-the-counter, American insurers wouldn't pay for it.

Offer them like they do some other medications.  Over the counter, but they are kept  behind the counter so you have to ask for them.

Some conservatives believe that an aspirin, held between the knees of a female, can prevent pregnancy. A different placement might prove more effective.

A large aspirin (500 mg +) can be used as a contraceptive, if it is forcefully inserted into the male, at the 'point' of arousal.

Difficult to get a woman pregnant when you have other things in your 'head'.

Even the threat of trying this would have a contraceptive effect.

A bunch of countries (24 I think) have higher overall math scores as well.  I wonder if there is a correlation?

Perhaps corporations concerned with contraception should consider a more pro-active approach. Women that become pregnant (who are covered by the company's health plan), and choose to have the baby, will be paid for all work hours missed (even if she does not work for that company, in the case of a spouse), receive all medical care during the pregnancy free of deductibles and co-pays, give the woman credit for any time lost, allow her to gain any benefits she would have been able to get, had she been in the workplace, physically (promotions, benefits, and pay increases) and will get 6 weeks of paid leave after the birth. Is that what Jesus would do?

Well duh, they also don't have stupid laws that show we are too scared of teaching our own kids how to have safe sex. We are not the #1 country in what would be called "smartness".

Poor countries don't require a prescription because that system is too expensive. Simple enough to figure out.

The reason a presciption is needed in the US is two-fold. 1} The religious right has always wanted to keep women barefoot and pregnant, so they've lobbied hard to keep the pill expensive and more difficult to get [we're lucky they let us have shoes, aren't we?] and 2} How can our 'for profit' medical system function if women aren't required to see their gyno every 6 months for a prescription and a useless exam?

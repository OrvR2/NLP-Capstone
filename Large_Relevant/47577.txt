A fire that swept through a crowded nightclub in southern Brazil early Sunday, Jan. 27, 2013, and killed more than 230 people appears to be the deadliest in more a decade. Witnesses said a flare or firework lit by band members may have started the blaze. Similar circumstances led to the the 2003 West Warwick, R.I., fire, where pyrotechnics used as a stage prop by the 1980s rock band Great White set ablaze cheap soundproofing foam on the walls and ceiling of the music venue.

Argentina, a year later. Thailand in 2008. Russia in 2009.
For survivors of a 2003 Rhode Island nightclub fire that was one of the deadliest in U.S. history, the fire in Brazil that killed hundreds Sunday is the latest in a series of reminders that no matter how far away, those who ignore the lessons of their tragedy can pay a horrible cost.
On a cold night in February 2003, the rock band Great White took the stage at The Station nightclub in West Warwick, R.I. During the show, pyrotechnics set fire to flammable soundproofing foam that lined the walls and ceiling, killing 100 and injuring 200.
Over the decade since, survivors have come together time and again over news of similar disastrous fires overseas.
"We're very tight," said Todd King, one of the survivors. "You can't put into words what we saw."
He said he was woken up Sunday morning by a storm of text messages from others who survived the Rhode Island fire, asking, "Can you believe this is happening again?"
"I'm surprised nobody has learned," he said.
Another Rhode Island survivor, Victoria Eagan, said she and others noted that each of three earlier fires was caused by indoor pyrotechnics igniting with material in the building. Investigators have just begun their work in Brazil, but witnesses said a flare or firework lit by band members may have started the fire.
"I had the same reaction as the other three times," Eagan said Sunday. "We're doomed to repeat history and I wish they could learn."
In the year after the Rhode Island fire, a flare ignited ceiling foam at an overcrowded nightclub in Buenos Aires, Argentina, killing 194 people.
Indoor fireworks were blamed for a fire at a club in Bangkok on New Year's Eve 2008 in which 66 partygoers were killed.
And another indoor fireworks display at a nightclub in Perm, Russia, ignited a plastic ceiling decorated with branches, killing 152 people in December 2009.
In Rhode Island, the Station fire brought about sweeping changes to the state's fire code with one intent: Never again.
Sprinklers are now required in nightclubs and bars with occupancy limits of 100 or more, nightclub workers must be trained in fire safety and more money was set aside for fire safety classes in schools.
Rhode Island also banned pyrotechnics in all but its largest public venues and local fire marshals were enabled to order immediate repairs and write tickets for violations.
Eagan said the changes were necessary in Rhode Island.
"I wish it would spread to other countries," she said.
A deadly blaze overseas does not seem so distant because of the Rhode Island tragedy, Eagan said.
"It's a tragedy that hits close to home," she said. "It's maddening to see it happen again."
In an emailed statement, the Station Fire Memorial Foundation, which is building a memorial to those affected by the 2003 fire, compared the two fires.
"One cannot help but notice the similarities between this tragedy and the Station nightclub fire that occurred nearly 10 years ago," the group said.

There's one thing I always do when going into a building that I'm not familiar with, and that is to scan it for all the POSSIBLE exits. Ya just never know.

Just to second Barbara, any establishment over a certain capacity with only one exit is breaking the law. Even if there are multiple exits, if they are not marked properly or are locked the law is being broken. Call 911 and the police and fire department will come out, the place will be shut down immediately and managers/owners _will_ be fined and arrested. If you are ever in a situation like that -- club, restaurant, or other venue -- please don't walk away. Not only fires but crushes and stampedes (e.g., E2 in Chicago in 2007) have killed people in the U.S. due to locked doors and frightened people defaulting to exiting out the entry point.

I have resolved that if I am ever in a club that uses pyrotechnics, I will leave right away.

If you have ever been caught in a mob panic you will never forget it.  I almost got killed going through a large plate glass window at the college concert hall because the idiots who were managing the ticket entry only had 2 doorways open to funnel people to a first come first seat show.  How stupid was this chet!  People got trampled to death at another venue the week before and others like me got injured.  I was lucky.
Panic of humans in any situation makes it a primal run for the door and all intelligence goes out the door.  Its like a living entity of ignorance you can not stop!

One thing we must PUSH for is not allowing a  Night club which holds 300 people,  being split into three so called  Separate night clubs to avoid the Fire safety laws.

Watching the amateur video from the Station Nightclub fire changed me forever.  I have never looked at public buildings the same way again.

univeral lesson----"it can't happen to me". we think it from the time we are born till, perhaps, when tragedy strikes. tis why mothers worry, fathers pace the floor and we have warnings. 
but  when your full of life and death happens to others, tragedies repeat themselves

well, you look at that photo - and you see what? maybe 30 people standing around - and you look at the size of what that club once was, understanding that some of those rooms were not for the club-going public - the you think that they were allowed to shoved 300 people in there...

Not much left of that place is there? I wonder if their government will se a neede to establish fire safety regulations in buisnesses like thsi one. You know like we have simple things like smopke detectors and fire escapes. most of the peopel dies because they couldn't get out of the place fast enough. Having enough outward opening doors does help  with that problem. And srpinkler systems slow down the fires spread so that it doesn't burn as much of the building. It also  gives paopla more time to get out. I wonder how those big government naysayers would feel if they got trapped in buring building with an inadequat number of exit doors?

The parents and families will suffer.  Perhaps they will have an influence on the way buildings and codes and safety will be handled.

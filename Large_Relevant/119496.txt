Rural Missouri Sheriff Talks to Schools About Arming TeachersResponse Time for Some Areas Could Be 20 MinutesBy William BrowningPostsWebsiteBy William Browning | Yahoo! Contributor Network – Mon, Jan 28, 2013

Christian County (Mo.) Sheriff Joey Kyle has had several conversations with school districts in his county regarding armed teachers in the classroom. KYTV reports Kyle cited response time by authorities in the event of an armed person invading a school. He said it would take up to 20 minutes for police or sheriff's deputies to get to some rural areas of the county. In that span of time, lives could be lost. Because of the tragedy in Newtown, Conn., Kyle believes arming teachers is one solution. Some school administrators showed concerns about the possibility.




What did Kyle say about how teachers should be armed?




The sheriff believes arming teachers is the "only way ... to fight fire," according to KYTV. He believes teachers should become more familiar with weapons thanks to more specialized training. Kyle claims it is the "appropriate application of force" that can diffuse mass tragedies.




How is arming teachers in line with the state's thinking?




A Springfield News-Leader piece on Kyle's meeting with area school administrators sheds light on what the sheriff wants to do. The newspaper states the elected official told school leaders, "We have an opportunity to set the course for the entire state with how we approach this. … It's not about arming teachers. It's about ... a mindset [as to] ... how is your staff going to respond to a violent act that's occurring in your school?"




What measures are schools already taking to prevent tragedies?




Schools in Nixa and Clever, Mo., already undergo preparedness drills. Kyle believes expanded gun training for teachers may be necessary, even in more urban settings where response times could be seven to 12 minutes. The sheriff suggests 40 hours of initial training with annual training to follow up. Larger cities such as Nixa and Ozark already have their own police force that could respond sooner than sheriff's deputies.




What have school administrators said in response to Kyle's assertions?




Nixa School District Superintendent Stephen Kleinsmith told the News-Leader, "I just don't see our board in the near future going to issuing out permission to arm employees, but that could be wrong as the research and reflection on the given issue is not complete."




Clever School District Superintendent Dr. Richard Henson told KYTV, "I think teachers are wired differently. I'm not saying there's not some, with proper training, could be good school defenders. Teachers make good teachers ... . People who come here to top threats are trained and wired to stop threats."




What about Missouri's actions and laws on gun control?




Missouri law states the governing bodies of schools can consent to allow staff to be armed under Missouri's concealed weapons law. The Associated Press notes Republicans in the Missouri General Assembly, who currently have a supermajority to override gubernatorial vetoes, want to lower the age of concealed weapons permits from 23 to 19. Another bill sponsored by Republicans wants to give teachers permission to be armed regardless of the decisions of a school board. The state's GOP also wants to nullify any possible federal legislation that could limit the right to bear arms.

ooooh...preparedness drills.  Let me tell you, as a teacher, they are not very reassuring.  States should do as Texas and pass a law allowing individual districts to determine if they want their teachers and admins armed or not.

I live in an area where it takes emergency people an hour to get to us, in good weather. Most of us have taken fire arms courses along with EMT. I also live in an area where earthquakes are common so you can be cut off from everything. I also live in an area where it is nothing new to have a bear or two walk into the school area as well being able to get inside the schools.  We all need to be prepared from having enough toilet paper to being able to protect yourself and for hunting. With all the modern technology it wouldn't take much for the whole system to be turned off. Be prepared. I see some of you against being armed. We have armed guards at our mines, oil refineries, banks, etc aren't our kids just as important to protect. They are our most valuable resource, our kids are our future.

When the GUN free zones signs are placed in front of the school building it is an open invitation to any mentally ill person to come in and commit act of violence. The only way to stop this in a rural area is to have the teachers armed or other school employees.  There should never be any place designated as gun free as all it does is make a target out of who is ever at the place.  Where I live the closest law enforcement is 12 miles away at the county seat if they are in the office when they out on patrol it could be 1/2 hour or more should you tell the armed intruder to wait until help arrives or take care of the job your self.

I remember when high school kids drove their pickups to school with their deer rifles in a gun rack and the superintendent and or principal would take their own guns from their gun rack and get with the kids and compare guns . There was never any problems

Keep in mind many people in rural Missouri are hunters.  It's not like they would be getting guns and training from scratch.

The problem with that is the teacher in CT was shot first, If the Principal had a gun, then She would still be alive.

How does he know how a teacher is wired? Everybody is wired differently. That was a broad statement and it certainly dosen't include ALL teachers.

America needs to pause, take a deep breath, relax. What happened at sandy hook was terrible, but thousands of teachers and students across America attend school every day without this. Quit scaring the daylights out of kids and teachers with this endless dialogue about weapons. Work toward a reasonable solution and when it comes together, make it public.

I lived in Missouri for 35 years.  Those folks mean business!  The sheriff is right.  Many schools are out in the boonies.  Armed teachers are needed.

I am proud that I live just a few miles from Christian County.  This sheriff is talking plain sense.  Teachers who choose to do so, should be allowed to exercise concealed carry at our schools.  They do not wish to become the next mass school shooting vicitms either. "Training" is his clarifying statement, and he understands the importance of that training.  We should recognize that a reasonably trained person with a firearm is the one best deterrent to these crazy, criminal mass shootings which now happen in our guaranteed unarmed victim packed zones which we clearly label "gun-free zones".

My guess is since your icon is a clan symbol, you've never left the south. Don't go preaching about what the world is if you've never seen it. If you had actually visited any part that isn't the north-west hemisphere, you wouldn't be as ignorant as you proudly flaunt.

Brilliant video. Even more brilliant canvas library/AI plugin. Its unfortunately (and idiotically) ironic that their site uses SILVERLIGHT for their videos. 

I, like most people, haven't had silverlight on any computers I've owned, ever. 3 years, and I ended up without the need only to break down and installing silverlight to view this fantastic product whos creators for some reason decided to use silverlight to explain how an HTML5 library works. Its absurd. Silverlight to demo HTML5... absurd

Wikipedia is more reliable than the encyclopedia britannica, but that's because its a collective of MANY people's insight. Fox News is biased, because its pushing a single narrative. That, plus their track record for misleading and lying, is what makes fox news unreliable.

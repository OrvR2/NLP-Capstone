All the angry cagers are jelly that doing this same thing with cars won't be as fun. All the drones are angry that their shitty, boring, meaninglessďťż lives were disrupted for a few minutes.

Am I the only one who actually thought the video was kind of cool? So what they held up traffic for a couple minutes, why are people always in such a hurry to go somewhere or be on the go all the time, the man wanted to propose, he did and everyone got onďťż with their lives. Congrats to the couple!

Believe it or not, a lot of times, I have better things to do than get stuck in traffic. If I thought sitting in my car in traffic was fun,ďťż I'd be doing that a lot more often than I currently do.
That's great that he wanted to propose - but why did he have to do it in the middle of a freeway and block traffic? If he really needed to propose in that manner, couldn't he have found an empty road to do it on? Plenty of creative/unique ways to propose without disrupting others.

Actually, some peopleďťż have jobs they're trying to get to. Even so, doing something I want, even if it is CoD (not that I play), is a more productive use of my time than someone else doing something completely unnecessary. There are a thousand different ways you can propose to someone without getting in everyone else's way and wasting their time.
Maybe you think you're that important, but to the rest of the world, you're not.

Wow, I've been riding sport bikes for over 20 years. Watching idiots like this ticks me off. It's the irresponsible actions of idiots bikers like these that f*cks it up for the rest of us. several years back my sport bike's insuranceďťż went from 675 dollars per year for full coverage to 2,100 dollars per year. The explanation I was given is that there was a lot of idiots crashing their sport bikes. Some insurance companies stop carrying sport bike insurance all together.

This guy is such a selfish piece of shit, this was more about getting attention rather than showing love for his girl. What happens between two people is their business, but it should never affect other people. Also, he proposed in such a way that the girl couldn't possiblyďťż say no, because everyone's watching. He should definitely get the death penalty.

WOW. And this is why everyone thinks motorcyclists are dumb and dangerous. These idiots over here enjoying their HUGE freeway stop messingďťż everyone up. For once, i was hoping one of those idiots fell off their bikes while trying to do a wheelie.
Also, this wasn't a very romantic place to propose. "Yea, my husband asked me on the 10 freeway where there are tens of hundred of potholes and cracks. Then i quickly jumped on the back of the bike and left." so sad.

Usually these are people that have never in their life ridden one and don't realize how much fun or how safe they can be when you are careful. Most of the myths about motorcycles are opinions ofďťż ignorant dumb dumbs. I don't spend a lot of time caring what dumb dumbs have to say. I feel the same about abortion vs religion, homorights vs yuckthatsnasty etc. You shouldn't either..

If they just moved few inches, ppl will at least be able to get of that freeway. And they wonder, why no one don't like bikers. Ppl like these just cast aďťż bad light on us.

you are so right, how dare peopleďťż be inconvenienced for a period of about 50-60 seconds while a man does something as stupid as demonstrate his love for his girl. When are people going to realize how much better this world is when we just work work work, drive drive drive, spend spend spend.

Well if they can do this, then everyone can. So the US has an approximate population of 310,000,000. Lets say 30,000,000 of those are going to express their love for one and other.
So that's 525949 minutes of inconveniences. Did you know that some major injuries can take justďťż minutes to die from? So I think you will find that those few minutes make all the differences to ambulances and other vehicles like it.

There's no way anyone that's stuck in the traffic you caused might be in an urgent to get to a place.. It's not like no one is sick, late, have a pressing matter to attend, or dying that day!!

Being a female i think this was very romantic. this man obviously loves his bride to be a lot and put a lot of time into this surprise for her. as you see in the video she was shocked as he was motioning her to get off the bike. every lady waits for this big moment when that special guyďťż asks her to marry him. 2-3 minutes traffic hold up is nothing in Cali. Congrats to the Bride & Groom to be... As the great Katt Williams says "Let the haters hate, that's they job"

really? because you haveďťż any proof that in THE 2-5 minutes they blocked traffic any people die because of missed ambulences? seriously it wasn't mature to block traffic but it's just as immature to castrize a group of people for doing something that was obviously good natured for a proposal. to many tools on here like you. I love 'what if's'. you can what if all day. police block roads all the time that could slow down people. give it a break, this was a 10 minute caused delay at max

if it's something that's so short as this dumb proposal which probably caused 10 minutes of traffic at max then I'd stomach it and not be a bitch. I've had plenty of important appointments in life but that doesn't mean I clownďťż around and whine or get road rage. you accept what is and move. it's not great to block traffic, but this was obviously in good will for a friend in their clubs marriage proposal. you all need to get a grip, traffic is at a stand still half the time as it is

I think it wouldve been better if they orchestrated this guys proposal when there was plenty of "normal" traffic backup. When everyone is just bored to death because traffic just got backed up as it usually does at certain times of the day, so that people could experience something cool to watch. Not when everybody's on their way to work. Anyways congrats and I'm glad thatďťż no accident was caused by this.

Honestly , I'm disappointed as well! I think you did a great thing by proposing , but why did it have to be at the cost of someone else's expense? I clearly you were merely thinking of building your own self image up as well! Pink smoke ! Come on Casanova , you are better than that.ďťż Next time consider doing things based on what she way want and not what makes you look and feel good! That's for free!

You can clearly see these IDIOTS blocking the breakdown lane. What if there were a medical emergency? They were blocking the breakdown lane used forďťż emergencies and medical vehicles. They were also blockingďťż the exit offramp. This is 100% fine worthy, frankly I think they deserve jail time for something so negligent.
Do you see the scores of cars stuck behind these bucks? Then you see the idiots running across the 4 lane bridge for a picture while not even looking? This is all so dumb.

It's not right for someone to cut in front of you in a lineďťż that might only mean a moment of delay - this is a simple matter of respect. The bikers had no respect. And for that, they are cretins.

Ok, it's not like this was a random ride - not that many bikers just end up in the same place like thatďťż by coincidence. If you've ever been on a rally ride or something you'll notice right off the bat that police stop traffic for the riders - including intersections and both sides of the road some times. Usually they escort too.

lol I'm just saying the only traffic you need be worried about was the other bikes because the police had probably closed everything down to accommodate them for the most part,ďťż as is typical.

Come on. Traffic was shut down for 30 seconds. So what. You're telling me this is a FELONY? A minor annoyance at best. I know nothing about these motorcycle groups and the pink smoke is ultra tacky, but it's harmless good fun. Why is it faggy? Please tell me how this amounts to a felony.

ACTUALLY - you can clearly see these IDIOTS blocking the breakdown lane. They are going slow and came to a full stop which was far longer than 30 seconds, the smoke could have blown to the other side and caused an accident and what if there was a medical emergency? They were blocking the breakdown lane used for emergencies and medical vehicles. This is 100% fine worthy,ďťż frankly I think they deserve jail time for something so negligent.

I dont care how romantic that was.. That was flat out inconsiderate and fuckin stupid!! and for all of you saying it only caused 2 minute delays thats bullshit! I drive LA's freeways everyday and if a freeway COMPLETELY STOPS for 2 minutes, it causes all sorts of delays and even accidents, andďťż im sure the traffic in the other direction got distracted as well. Next time propose at a baseball game or something but out of the way and considerate to others.

I'm glad you think so.
What's going to be so interesting is when the last white man is gone...What race of people do you think is responsible for YOUR freedoms if you live in the USA, andďťż the drafting of the most incredible document in the history of man that led to the creation of a country that allows you such latitude and rights?
Once the white man is gone what made the USA "the place" all of you other races want to come to will cease to exist. "WE" created what benefited other races.

Eh, unless i'm in the middle of an emergency (life or death are the only real emergencies) I wouldn't really mind being stopped for a second. Good for them. I hope it brings them lifelong happiness.
P.S. I'm an EMT. Rig's almost NEVER go on the free-way. I never had a priority call where I took the free-way. Hospitals are dense and local. Especially in cities such as these. Free-ways are too out of the way and actually take longer. Very doubtful there wasďťż an ambulance in priority there

Not really. Unless they are BMW's or racing bikes made by ducatti. Thoseďťż can reach up to the 90k mark. But those are real racing bikes, the kind of machines you load up on your truck to take on the freeway, you don't ride around that close to others or do wheelies on them. Tell me, would you treat your bike like these candyasses do if it cost you 50k?

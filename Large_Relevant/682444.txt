After reading ZHUKOV'S MEMOIRS, i understand KURSK, it was a death trap for the germans, ZHUKOV wanted to let them bleed then use ROTMISTROVS tanks and men in reserve to conuter attack and finish the german armies for good, PLAN A didn't work because waffen SS panzer divisions unde GEN HAUSSER got penetration. Anyway germans lacked INFANTRY after STALINGRAD and Zhukov knew it, he had detailed information of every german formation, also there was shortage of aviation fuel what made difference.

As ultimas noticias  KIKO esta na cadeia, mas o dono mesmo era um outro dono do ABSINTO HALL. os dois tiveram suas propriedades congeladas. O KIKO parece ser o responsavel, era NEGLIGENTE nao gostava de extintor de incendio, escondia eles e quando tinha vistoria colocava de volta. A NEGLIGENCIA do KIKO e a IGNORANCIA do cantor da banda com o SPUTNIK causaram esta tragedia. Espero que eles paguem  e sirva de exemplo para todos que tem casa noturna.

Sabia que uns imbecis fariam critica religiosa, porque nao tem raciocinio so repetem as baboseiras religiosas sem nenhum exercicio mental.Anne voce esta certa tem pessoas que nao conseguem ver a realidade. Sobre os jovens se divertirem e normal da juventude, o que aconteceu foi uma negligencia enorme de alguns, nenhuma seguranca na boate, so interessado no dinheiro. Meu amigo e dono de boate em New Jersey, seguranca para os patrons e a prioridade numero 1. esse jovens nao deveriam morrer

What a senseless tragedy because of NEGLIGENCE of just a few. The huge number of dead is due to smoke inhalation, it happens so fast , 3 breaths of that thick smoke and you are in deep trouble, most of these deaths happened in minutes. Heard that the entrance were blocked too, so minutes that could saved lives were wasted by security. STAMPEDE and ASPHYXIATION happens so fast that nobody can even think clearly.

Duh? of course the smoke killed 99% of the victims, it is always like that in similar cases, NEGLIGENCE is to blame, how they have such huge crowd without a working fire extinguisher or trained people to use them, who was in control of the security and overall, no walk talkies? Mostly bizarre the entrances were blocked, what a shame for this club owner, and also the singer of the band using SPOUTINIK inside, what an idiot. Hope there is some punishment, but that is Brazil, doubt it.

Nao disse que nao acredito em DEUS, eu sei alguma coisa, eu nao tenho crenca porque ja sou mais esclarecido, sei algumas coisas. Essa tragedia foi terrivel e pior quando vi as fotos dos mortos, dai e que fica mais triste, nem da para entender como pessoas tao boas saudaveis inteligentes bonitas com um bom  futuro a frente morrem tao rapido em minutos por causa de um cantor que cometeu um acidente. Falar que Deus e misericordioso e o oposto desta tragedia(fale punitivo e faz mais senso)

E chamada NEGLIGENCIA, tinha de ter extintor de incendio a cada 1500 square feet, a banda comecou o fogo e tentou apagar com garrafa de agua e quando seguranca deu extintor, ou nao funcionou ou nao sabia usar(remover o pin de seguranca), dai o leader da banda resolveu sair mansinho do club, nem alertaram o pessoal, quando chegaram perto da entrada nao tinha luz nem sinal de saida visivel, so fumaca. Tem de por na cadeia o cantor da banda e o dono da casa noturna.

I know i was in such a club in SAO PAULO by the time of John Travolta era, thousand of people, once there was a fight i had to choose between STAMPED or FIGHT i stayed in the club in a distant position while the fight continued until security came in, if we had a fire there was no way to evacuate in a single exit, hundreds would die. But look in the USA in Rhode Island with all strict FIRE CODE  regulations 100 died in similar situation, pirotecnics started fire, like here the band survived

You mean 3 front war. Forgot about England when Hitler invaded USSR( should had waited  another year so to have enough transport, by the way all those 600 thousand horses died of exhaustion or cold in 1941) some complained( Adolf Galand the air force ace) of opening a second front(eastern front).

I almost finished reading ZHUKOV'S MEMOIRS and i am surprised how intelligent STALIN was, he with ZHUKOV and VASILEVSKY were architects of STALINGRAD the biggest battle in history so decisive that ended any hope of german victory in the eastern front. The germans lost so much material and men in the DON/VOLGA/STALINGRAD AREA that it couldn't replace it .

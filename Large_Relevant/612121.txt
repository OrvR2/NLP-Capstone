DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Bangladesh's government has ordered an investigation into allegations that the sole emergency exit was locked at a garment factory where a fire killed seven female workers, an official said Sunday.
The fire Saturday at the Smart Export Garment Ltd. factory occurred just two months after a blaze killed 112 workers in another factory near the capital, raising questions about safety in Bangladesh's garment industry, which exports clothes to leading Western retailers. The gates of that factory were locked.
Government official Jahangir Kabir Nanak said an investigation has been ordered into the cause of Saturday's fire and allegations that the emergency exit was locked.
Altaf Hossain, father of a garment worker killed in the latest fire, has filed a police case against three directors of the factory, accusing them of negligence involving the fire, Dhaka Metropolitan Police Sub-inspector Shamsul Hoque told The Associated Press on Sunday.
He said police had begun an investigation.
Doctors said most of the victims died from asphyxiation.
"When I tried to escape through the emergency exit I found the gate locked," Raushan Ara, a worker at the factory, was quoted as saying by Dhaka's Prothom Alo newspaper.
The newspaper said at least 50 people were injured in a stampede triggered by the fire. Six were hospitalized, while others received first aid treatment on their own.
Some of the injured jumped out of the windows of the two-story factory, survivors said.
Dhaka Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Monzurul Kabir said the bodies of seven women were recovered from the top floor of the factoryt. He said the factory was making pants and shirts, but could not provide further details.
Fire official Abdul Halim said it took firefighters about two hours to bring the blaze under control.
Volunteers joined firefighters in battling the fire as a large crowd gathered outside the factory awaiting word on the fate of relatives. Family members were seen crying near the body of a female worker named Josna, who was 16.
About 250 workers were working at the time of the fire, newspapers said.
It was not immediately known if the factory produced garments for any international companies. The owner was not available for comment, and the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association said the factory was not a member so it had no details.
Earlier this month, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. alerted its global suppliers that it will immediately drop them if they subcontract their work to factories that haven't been authorized by the discounter. The stricter contracting rule, along with other changes to its policy, come amid increasing calls for better safety oversight after the deadly fire in late November at a factory owned by Tazreen Fashions Ltd. that supplied clothing to Wal-Mart and other retailers. Wal-Mart has said the factory wasn't authorized to make its clothes.
Wal-Mart ranks second behind Swedish fast fashion retailer H&M in the number of clothing orders it places in Bangladesh.
Fires have led to more than 600 deaths of garment workers in Bangladesh since 2005, according to research by the advocacy group International Labor Rights Forum.

I'd like to place these multinational corporation executives in one of these factories and lock the doors. See how they like it.

American industry in their quest for higher and higher profits from slave labor is just as responsible for this type of event as the ones who locked the door.

Keep buying your designer jeans and tennis shoes even knowing they're made in sweat shops and you'll keep reading reports like this tragedy.  Buy American at every cost.

Why even have an emergency exit if you end up locking it?

There you go!  There is your precious  free enterprise!  They were free to roast or suffocate.  But it is all worth it because they have no evil unions to worry about there.

In a Global Economy/Nafta, The workers in coutries such as this will never be elevated to our standard of living, Only exploited by corporations for there cheap labor,unregulated work enviroments and when you kill some people there will be no Million dollar lawsuits.
 In the end we will be dragged down to their standard of living, Should have listened to Ross Perot when he said after Nafta the sucking sound you would here woukld be our Jobs leaving the country.

So why are the exits locked? Could it be that the workers are slaves, locked in so they can't leave?

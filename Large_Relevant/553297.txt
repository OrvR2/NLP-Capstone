Some random thoughts on recent events and our "Gun Culture."  If you hate guns and gun owners, please go elsewhere; this is not your forum or blog. This is a shooting channel.One of the key points I wanted to make here is that for millions of Americans, guns are as common as golf clubs, baseballs & gloves, or any other sporting equipment people have around the house. Other than the obvious need to be careful with them, as with vehicles, matches, gasoline, etc., I regard them as nothing different from anything else. When visiting friends or relatives over the decades, it's nothing for me to throw in a few firearms to take along that I know they might enjoy seeing or shooting. I'm lucky to live in the United States, as well as in a "free state."  For example, I might visit a gun shop today, literally, and perhaps see  a gun I want to purchase. If so, it will take about five minutes to do the paperwork and get the background check online. I'll bring it home and be shooting the gun  within minutes. It's just not a big deal. This is what so many people cannot relate to, I suppose, especially if they've grown up in a family or country where firearms are considered "dangerous" and just not around much. Having grown up in Kentucky and Tennessee, firearms for me are as much a part of life as fireworks, basketball, football, or boating. The fact that there are some "bad" or "crazy" people in the world who murder, rape, steal, torture, stab, shoot people, etc. just has very little to do with me. I do NONE of those things and have no inclination to do so. I am very thankful I have the easy means to prevent any of that from happening to me. I understand if your experience is far different from mine, but I'm darn sure not going to allow you to determine how I live MY life.  By the way, a few facts:The "AR" in AR15 stands for Armalite Rifle; they introduced the rifle.Semi-automatic rifles and technology have been around for over 100 years.An "Assault Weapon" is a firearm capable of full-auto fire. These are already very highly regulated and require a long waiting period and Federal Stamp. Virtually none of the ARs and AKs in gun shops, gun shows, and citizens' hands are  "Assault Weapons," of course.Gun-Free Zones serve as "Easy Murder Zones" for  any psychopath who chooses to do it.

Hello from Knoxville! It was a pleasure meeting you at the Nashville Rally. I was the guy in the front with the﻿ Navy cap & took your pic with my cell phone. Thank you for turning up. Tell tnoutdoors to show up next time as well.

Thanks for showing up! Good to meet YOU, too. We can't keep Tnoutdoors9 from doing videos and posting them, but we DO try to keep him out of public areas so that he doesn't scare the little kids with that face! :-) Actually, he was out of town on business, or he would﻿ have been there.

I believe hickok45 should be an armed teacher﻿ able to protect students from insane murderers whatever their weapon of choice. I contacted my representative about supporting hr35 the Safe Schools Act of 2013. Frangible bullets could do the job in a classroom.

Sorry, but I do NOT inform the "authorities" when I swap or pass on﻿ a firearm. WE're all in trouble once registration comes about.

Have to disagree. multiple unecesseary deaths by crazy people will lead to confiscation. Which genocide in particular?
Constitution was drawn up and agreed by government, pick & choose how and which laws you abide by and that gives them the excuse to interfere.
The﻿ Authorities didn't open up in a theatre or a school of 7 year olds.
You're right the police knowing where the guns were wouldn't stop him. But I'd lock up the gun's owner for failure to properly secure a weapon leading to homicide.

Mass shootings are setups, just like they were (its now well known) in 1968, hopefully these won't be fruitfull to the evil people that ordered them like they were back then. Oh and isn't that strange than we went to 0 mass shootings on the tv or elsewere to mass shootings every day on every channel in 3 month ?﻿ Obama is looking more and more like hitler to me, they has in common using custom made up fear to pass anticonstitutionnal laws, don't give up on your liberty, fight for it.

Wrong way of handling them maybe they should ban these Games they let them play all the time and pay more attention to the children instead of setting them in front of a TV all evening long , I had grown up with guns in our house my whole family had guns we were taught right from wrong all the time and the﻿ safety of using a gun , we mainly used ours to hunt with and to survive with there not a toy , but people now days are wearied about themselves instead of teaching right from wrong on weapon

I have been a life member of NRA﻿ since the mid 70's , been through the guns bans same as you have been , and you are so right all it does is stirs up a nest of bees make prices of everything go up on weapons , ammo and reloading equipment ,exc. but until these and the government realize its not going to stop people out here from killing they are wrong , i think instead of trying to take away all of these things maybe they should teach more about weapons in a class in the school the right and wro

You know he's right it is an insanity issue. How many of you know that on the same day of the Newtown shooting that in China 22 children were injured by﻿ a man with a KNIFE. Are they going to start banning knifes now? No we need to control the insane and learn to store our weapons safely and away from our children this is OUR RESPONSIBILITY too as gun owners. Look at the school shooting in California where a kid GOT A HOLD OF HIS BROTHERS SHOTGUN AND SHOT AND CRITICALLY INJURED ONE STUDENT.

Well done Mr. Hickok, been watching about five years now & like the objective way you present your videos especially this one, wasnt aware you were a teacher. IMO some sanity would go a lot further in helping with the random shooting issue than knee jerk gun bans. As always a tool as well as a gun can be used or it can be abused with expected results either way, its a mental health issue not a hardware issue, keep the guns away from the disturbed abusers, dont﻿ disarm responsible owners.

Really good video. He should have spoken on behalf of the NRA. This was very﻿ persuasive (and I'm probably in the anti gun spectrum).

Send a shock wave to Dianne Feinstein and the extreme left.﻿ Sign the petition to repeal Senate Bill SBX211. When the entire Los Angeles Superior Court Judges face possible felony charges for accepting money that was NOT authorized by law. That should put them back on their heels for a while.
Google SBX211 and sign the petition.

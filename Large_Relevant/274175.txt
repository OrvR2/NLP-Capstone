President Barack Obama's history-making embrace of gay marriage could send far-reaching political aftershocks through a presidential campaign defined by voter concerns about the economy but likely decided by slivers of the electorate in a handful of battleground states.
"The politics, it's not clear how they cut in some places that are going to be pretty important in this electoral map. It may hurt me," Obama told Robin Roberts of ABC News in an exclusive interview Wednesday as he announced his change of heart. "I believe marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman," presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney said as he campaigned in Oklahoma.
A Democratic senator who supports Obama's re-election as well as gay marriage told Yahoo News that the president could face "significant electoral risk" if his announcement is merely a check-the-box exercise with no follow-through.
"If the president simply makes an important commitment to equality and moves on, and does not challenge the network of people nationally, activists and others, who favor marriage equality, to speak up from now through the election, he is taking a significant electoral risk," said the senator, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified by name.
"When you move from 'civil union' to the word 'marriage,' it reaches people differently," the senator said in a telephone interview, warning that highly motivated foes of gay marriage will unleash a campaign of "public speeches, sermons, newsletters, websites, that will darkly suggest a negative future."
Obama echoed that sentiment, telling ABC News: "I had hesitated on gay marriage in part because I thought civil unions would be sufficient, that that was something that would give people hospital visitation rights and other elements that we take for granted, and I was sensitive to the fact that for a lot of people, you know, the word 'marriage' was something that evokes very powerful traditions, religious beliefs, and so forth."
Richard Socarides, a leading gay activist who served as President Bill Clinton's top adviser on issues like same-sex marriage, said Obama "can help build a national consensus."
"Nobody expects the president to make this a central feature of his presidency, but it is an important issue," Socarides told Yahoo News by telephone.
Other Obama supporters pointed to a Gallup national poll, released Tuesday, showing that the country has been "evolving" on the issue along with the president.
The public opposed gay marriage by a lopsided margin of 68 percent to 27 percent when Gallup first asked the question in 1996. In 2012, for just the second year, a narrow majority of 50 percent favored making it legal, with 48 percent against. (The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.) Independent voters were strongly in favor, 57 percent to 40 percent, which on the surface would seem to help the embattled incumbent.
In what both sides expect to be a hotly contested election, the outcome could turn on relatively few voters in up-for-grabs states—like North Carolina, which voted 61 percent to 39 percent Tuesday to adopt a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and civil unions. Obama beat John McCain there by just 13,692 ballots in 2008, and he leads Mitt Romney by 2.4 percentage points according to a Real Clear Politics average of polls.
"It was important for me, given how much attention this issue was getting—both here in Washington but elsewhere—for me to go ahead, let's be clear, here's what I believe," Obama told ABC News.
"But I'm not going to be spending most of my time talking about this, because frankly my job as president right now, my biggest priority, is to make sure that we're growing the economy, that we're putting people back to work, that we're managing the draw-down in Afghanistan effectively," he said. "Those are the things that I'm going to focus on."
One in 6 of the Obama campaign's "bundlers"—who corral big money donors—is gay, according to the Washington Post.
There is little evidence to support the oft-repeated claim that coming out in favor of gay marriage will cost Obama much support among black voters.
But political analysts also point to working-class, white, religious voters in pivotal states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, and conservative-leaning independents in other important states like Iowa and Nevada as potentially put off by Obama's new position.

"African-American voters, who tend to be less sympathetic to gay marriage than white voters, are very enthused about Obama and, I think, this won't change that," said Ohio State University political science professor Paul Allen Beck .
"But the question in places like Ohio will be how this affects blue-collar white voters who might otherwise be predisposed to vote Democratic. For some of them, particularly the ones who are more deeply religious, this could be important," Beck told Yahoo News.
"For almost all Americans, this won't be directly a factor in November. But elections are won and lost at the margins, especially in Ohio," Beck said.
Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey's re-election fight highlights the difficult balancing act for politicians in swing states. Casey opposes gay marriage but favors allowing civil unions. His Republican opponent, Tom Smith, would favor a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman, but would not support a ban on civil unions, Smith's campaign manager Jim Conroy told Yahoo News by telephone.
But the Obama campaign may have calculated that the president's waffling—it could no longer be dubbed "Clintonian" after Bill Clinton actively campaigned against the North Carolina amendment—would tarnish his "hope and change" brand and dampen enthusiasm among liberal Democrats, young voters and single women, all key parts of his winning coalition in 2008.
"They ripped off the Band-Aid, didn't they?" a Democratic congressional aide told Yahoo News, saying that Vice President Joe Biden's endorsement of same-sex marriage on "Meet The Press" Sunday had forced the White House to confront "head-on" an issue it had hoped not to take up.
Speaking to reporters after a campaign event in Oklahoma City, Romney said his position on same sex marriage was unchanged.
"I have the same view on marriage that I had when I was governor. I believe marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman," Romney said. "I have the same view I've had since, well, running for office."
Conservative activist Ralph Reed, now head of the Faith And Freedom Coalition, predicted that Obama's decision would fire up conservative voters.
"This is an unanticipated gift to the Romney campaign. It is certain to fuel a record turnout of voters of faith to the polls this November," he said in a statement on the group's Facebook page.
And Brad Dayspring, a shrewd former aide to House Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor now advising a conservative super PAC, accused Obama of trying to use a "culture war" to distract voters from the sour economy.
"Once again the President refuses to put economy and jobs first. All of our focus should start there," Dayspring said on Twitter.
In 1996, Obama said on a campaign questionnaire in Illinois, "I favor legalizing same-sex marriages, and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages." White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer later disavowed that statement, saying "someone else, not the president" had filled it out.
As president, Obama signed a law repealing the "don't ask, don't tell" ban on openly gay servicemembers, and ordered his administration to stop defending in court the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibits the federal government from recognizing same-sex unions.
"My feelings about this are constantly evolving," Obama told reporters at a press conference one month after Republicans romped in the November 2010 midterm elections.

"I struggle with this. I have friends, I have people who work for me, who are in powerful, strong, long-lasting gay or lesbian unions. And they are extraordinary people, and this is something that means a lot to them and they care deeply about," Obama said.
He went on to say: "At this point, what I've said is, is that my baseline is a strong civil union that provides them the protections and the legal rights that married couples have. And I think—and I think that's the right thing to do. But I recognize that from their perspective it is not enough, and I think is something that we're going to continue to debate and I personally am going to continue to wrestle with going forward."
People in Ohio have been "evolving" on the issue, too, said Beck, the political scientist. Ohio "public opinion probably has changed, as it has nationally," he said.
But "how much it has changed, I don't know."

heck with all the political and homosexual issues. how can half you people understand these comments with all the horrendous spelling and grammar problems. people on here crucify yahoo for it lack of proofreading and editing when over half the people commenting and leaving posts are usually worst than the article itself. and we complain about our educational system in america. some examples, "linchpin"?? lynchpin, marihuana?? marijuana. and not knowing the differen between there and their, or your and you're. this may be just and informal post but sometimes one word can mean the difference between whether or not someone understands and agrees with you. you're taking a few minutes to type a comment on something you feel strongly about, take another few moments to proofread yourself. Can't yell at yahoo for editing if you don't do it yourself.

The folks who are getting the free stuff, don't like the folks who are paying for the free stuff, Because the folks who are paying for the free stuff, Can no longer afford to pay for both the free stuff and their own stuff,
And,
The folks who are paying for the free stuff, Want the free stuff to stop. and the the folks who are getting the free stuff,Want even more free stuff on top of the free stuff they are already getting!
Now...
The people who are forcing the people who Pay for the free stuff, Have told the people who are RECEIVING the free stuff, That the people who are PAYING for the free stuff, Are being mean, prejudiced, and racist.
So...
the people who are GETTING the free stuff, Have been convinced they need to hate the people who are paying for the free stuff, By the people who are forcing some people to pay for their free stuff, and giving them the free stuff in the first place.

We have let the free stuff giving go on for so long that there are now more people getting free stuff than paying for the free stuff.

Now understand this. All great democracies have committed financial suicide somewhere between 200 and 250 years after being founded.  The reason ? The voters figured out they could vote themselves money from the treasury by electing people who promised to give them money from the treasury in exchange for electing them.

The United States officially became a Republic in 1776, 231 years ago. The number of people now getting free stuff outnumbers the people paying for the free stuff. We have one chance to change that in 2012.

Failure to change that spells the end of the United States as we know it.

It was a totally engineered campaign move. Obama doesn't make a flip-flop without it being fully polled to know what the results will be. How conviently that Biden almost on cue read the prepared script on the subject and the next day Obama claims he was evolving his position on the issue. And that new revelation just the day before he meets with the Hollywood liberals at Clooneys party and rakes in the cash. Well he did promiss to be the most transparent president ever and if you can't see through his smoke and mirrors you shouild turn in your voter I.D. card and admit you aren't qualified to intellegently check the boxes.

For or against, the people who feel this is a linchpin issue were already voting for or against Obama..........makes no difference.  Economics and Foreign Policy will always take the fore.

Attorney General Eric Holder's people have no shame. After months of stonewalling, misinformation and petulant disregard for the victims of the Fast and Furious gunwalking scandal, President Obama's Justice Department is hiding behind the most despicable race-card demagogues on the planet. "Post-racial" America never looked so bitter, clingy and cowardly.
At a Tuesday press conference in Washington, D.C., human shield Al Sharpton condemned the upcoming House vote on a contempt motion against Holder as "reckless" and "morally reprehensible." Yes, the infamous hate-crimes hoaxer, cop-basher and riot incitement specialist is now the self-appointed sheriff of Capitol Hill morality. A Huffington Post report hyping Sharpton's protection racket decried the contempt citation as an "assault on minority rights." In typical race-baiting style, Sharpton told the leftwing website: "I'm not saying that this is because Holder is black, and I'm not calling (Republicans) racists. I'm saying what they're doing has a racial effect."
Of course Sharpton's accusing Republicans of racism — and by extension, he's smearing every American demanding truth and justice in Obama's bloodiest scandal. That includes the family of murdered Border Patrol agent Brian Terry, whose December 2011 death came at the hands of a Mexican thug wielding a Fast and Furious weapon. What about the Mexican government officials left in the dark about the deadly operation? And the hundreds of families of Mexican victims of Fast and Furious-enabled bloodshed? Yes, yes, they are all racists and minority vote suppression advocates, too.
Sharpton forged ahead, comparing the effort to hold Holder accountable for his serial delays and deception to racial profiling. The race-hustling reverend invoked driving-while-black imagery in lambasting the Republican oversight staffers who have "stopped and frisked" Holder, the nation's first black attorney general, "without probable cause" to be "made an example of."
While he regurgitated DOJ talking points about Holder's "unprecedented" level of cooperation, Sharpton neglected to mention that the agency has delivered less than 8 percent of the 80,000 documents sought by congressional investigators. He forgot to acknowledge that of the 70 DOJ officials involved in Fast and Furious, 48 have been blocked by DOJ from testifying. He failed to detail the withdrawn Feb. 4, 2011, letter to Congress falsely denying the existence of Fast and Furious, Holder's flip-flops over what he knew and when, and Holder's blame-shifting assertion, withdrawn last week, that falsely accused former Bush Attorney General Michael Mukasey of being briefed on a separate gunwalking operation.
Lest we forget, the White House's racial guardian and MSNBC host is the same bigoted clown who manufactured the Tawana Brawley fake hate crime and tried to frame police officers, railed against "Chinamen," "Greek homos" and "n****rs," inveighed against Jewish "diamond merchants," and stoked black mobs at white-owned Freddy's Fashion Mart in Harlem, which was burned to the ground in 1995 after protesters broke in and gunned down four employees.
Team Obama can no more dissociate itself from Sharpton's bloody legacy than Sharpton can dissociate himself from his own poisonous tongue. In return for his blind and tireless defense over the past year and a half, Holder has publicly embraced Sharpton and endorsed his toxic racial smokescreen. In April, Holder lavished praise on Sharpton "for your partnership, your friendship and your tireless efforts to speak out for the voiceless, to stand up for the powerless and to shine a light on the problems we must solve and the promises we must fulfill." Obama himself addressed Sharpton's spring convention, as did several other Cabinet secretaries. White House visitor logs show more than a dozen entries for "Al Sharpton" or "Alfred Sharpton" over the past three years.
President Clinton had his Sister Souljah moment: a public attempt in 1992 to distance Democrats from radical racial demagoguery. The current White House has turned that centrist maneuver on its head, and American voters of good will shouldn't forget it. Obama's Brother Sharpton moment, a calculated deflection from the Fast and Furious scandal, is an unrepentant bear hug of racial extremism. Shame, shame, shame.

This has become an all too predictable knee-jerk reaction among the leftists: as soon as anyone specifies one of the many failings of the Obama administration or points out what an utter disaster the Obama presidency has been, libs/dems try to play the race card. As always, when libs/dems are confronted with any sort of irrefutable facts, fact-based reasoning, or just plain old common sense logic, rather than even try to attempt to construct a well-reasoned response, they simply resort to childish name calling and charges of "racism".

Al's business cards:

Al Sharpton
Race Pimp

Available for baiting at a party near you. 

When are you black voters going to figure out that it's actuall Jesse and Al that are holding your progress up? Less than 10% of this country is "racist" under the Webster's defintion. The people you refer to as racists are actually bigots and there is no color in bogotry.

Al, a simple yes or no type question for you - is there anything that Holder should be held accountable for in his capacity as U.S. Attorney General?

Why does anyone listen to Al Sharpton?  He has proven himself to be a racist idiot.  It is very simple, don't print anything about him and don't give him any air time.  Why is he allowed to work on CNN or whatever new show he's on, I change the channel if his face comes on, but be such an in your face racist?  Could you imagine if a white man did the same thing?  Sharpton can talk all he wants but the laws are pretty clear as to what a President can and can't do and what Presidents and others MUST do when they are involved in proceedings. Obummer is going to go down in smoke.  I hope it happens soon.  Every once in a while the media claims there are indications the economy is improving.  I don't want to hear Obummer taking credit for it as he selfishly tries to get another four years to run down the country.  They also need to get him on the security leaks.  Very dumb and irresponsible actions for a Commander in Chief.  He can't dance around that infraction.  Start packing Mitt.  You going to DC soon.

"sand nigger'' ... says it all , doesn't it? the manipulators love this kind of stuff.... exactly what they're after. I don't like Islam, personally... it's vile, as is ALL 'religion'... someone's comment about treatment of women, or buggering little boys... jeese... sounds like the Catholic 'church' doesn't it? because it IS... playground for pedaphiles, if there ever was one. WE are the PEOPLE, people ... we have to work together against the real evil... psychopaths with obscene wealth

I have some good friends in Norway... once again, not perfect... but laughable to call them 'failed states' in comparison to the the United States of Uneducated ... increasingly vacuous TV gazers...

I wish I could write something 'tolerant' sounding, like 'we must learn to respect each other's differences... blah blah.'' but the fact is, if someone is threatening, then there's nothing to 'respect' ... frankly, RELIGION is the root of all evil... period. Islam, the Pope, etc etc... it's fascism... 'do what I believe, without question, or I'll kill you' .. this is what it ALWAYS leads to... NO MORE TAX BREAKS for 'religions' ... no more special treatment of ANY kind.

the story is about banks... or more accurately, a small group of criminals very successfully gaming the banking system. It is not about ''enemy of Europe - Jew ''  Racial slurs only serve to obfuscate the essential elements of this or any story, and their only true value is to reveal the jingoism of the  commentator .

If indeed 'they' were behing all this etc etc... this guy would NOT be someone chosen to participate... who knows what happened... YOU sure don't... stay calm, please ...

What Slain Sandy Hook Student Daniel Barden’s Brother And Sister Want President Obama To Do
by Tommy Christopher | 3:03 pm, December 19th, 2012

On Katie Couric‘s syndicated Katie program, the parents of 6 year-old Daniel Barden, one of the 20 children tragically killed last Friday at Sandy Hook Elementary School, told Couric that their time spent with President Obama at Sunday’s prayer vigil was “a little less fruitful than we were hoping.”
Daniel’s father, John Barden, said that Daniel’s 12 year-old brother James, and 10 year-old sister Natalie, had some things to tell the President that they didn’t get to, and since they’re unlikely to get a seat at the table with legislators and lobbyists, the President should listen to them here.
At a press conference Wednesday afternoon, President Obama announced a working group, to be led by Vice President Joe Biden, that will produce recommendations as to what can be done to prevent future tragedies, and laid down the same markers that political and media types have been urging  as a starting point: banning the sale of military-style assault weapons, banning the sale of high-capacity ammunition clips, and requiring background checks before all gun purchases. While this is a sea change from our pre-Connecticut conversation on gun control, it is miles away from where Daniel’s sister, Natalie Barden, thinks it should start.
“My daughter, Natalie, was interested in asking him if he could pass some legislation so that the only people that had guns were military personnel and law enforcement,” Mr. Barden told Katie Couric, “And if people needed guns for sport, they could go to a range, and the guns would have to stay there. That was my 10-year-old daughter. That was all her own original thought.”
Twelve year-old James Barden, who asked that he be allowed to speak with Katie about his brother, said he wanted to ask the President “what he was going to do to make sure this never happens again. Because it should never happen again, no one should ever have to go through this.”
Mr. Barden added that he and his wife are “still not even really fully aware, or really haven’t processed or absorbed or digested the fact that our sweet little Daniel is not here with us any more. That’s all we’re trying to deal with at this moment.”
Since James and Natalie are unlikely to make it onto Vice President Biden’s working group, they should at least listen to what they had to say here:

What the President said at today’s press conference is representative of an establishment consensus that we should begin with the “easy stuff,” but the suggestion that Natalie makes illustrates the need to fundamentally alter our assumptions about gun policy, and, to paraphrase President Obama, not let that which is possible become the enemy of what is right.
The full interview is both heartbreaking and near-poetic in its depiction of this family’s loss. Mom Jackie Barden recalls some moments from the morning of the shooting, when dad John lost a game of Foosball to Daniel by a score of 10-8, and then taught him to play Jingle Bells on the piano.
“Yeah, we did a lot in that half-hour,” John said, with a palpable mixture of heartbreak and gratitude, adding “So, we held hands on the way to the bus.”
Mr. Barden remembered that James also saw his brother that morning. “He did get up early that morning and ran down the driveway so he could kiss his brother good-bye in his pajamas. It was 22 degrees.”
Those memories, frozen in time, as precious and as hard as diamonds, will live forever in the hearts of everyone who hears them.
Here’s the full interview, from Katie:

Incredibly sad for those kids but we don’t exactly let 10 & 12 year-olds make national policy.  And, hopefully, the lefty media won’t use them as pawns to advance their narrative. 
No laws or bans would have changed what happened last week.  That’s the sad reality.






freedomrocks4



Advance their narrative? Too late TC already is trying

That law enforcement and soldiers being the only ones with guns thing will never happen. Though maybe the idea that only soldiers/cops should have access to CERTAIN weapons should be considered.

Children live in a Utopia world till tragedy strikes and then wonder how it happened.  Explaining to a child evil exist is not a great thing to do, but a responsible thing to do.  If the childs response to the incident was only that easy to fix it would be. it’s not and the grownups must also admit evil does exist, while the only way to stop evil is with equal or greater force. 
One more gun in the right hands may have daniel home with his parents today. To deny that fact is to live in that childs Utopia.
I type this while listening to my grandchild reading a christmas poem, she just came home from school to visit.. I could not imagine the anger and sorrow one would have for politicians that did not do their best to protect my children while politicians had been protected off my tax dollars. cowards is the only response that comes to mind.

you again huh? What a pea brained moron you are. Who are you to say what would happen or not? Are you God now? The only ‘sad reality’ is that this nation is populated with people like you…

And I was going to say just the opposite. How it’s amazing that children this young – their LOGICAL minds not yet poisoned by NRA propaganda, paranoia, and fear mongering – can come up with a solution that seems best for securing THEIR FUTURES.
Funny how “you folks” would dismiss these kids, yet aren’t so taken back by the revelation that the Grover Norquist Tax Pledge was something he dreamed up in middle school? More GOP hypocrisy.

Didn’t the first victim have a extensive training and a cache of weapons readily available to her?

the sleeping victim yes.. and this relates how? we already know mental illness and her failure to keep the arms away was a fault. But fault in society exist while bodyguarded politicians ignore they themselves have the protection they wish others would give up.
Anything that could have saved even one more child should be used in defense of a child. The main issue is defense of children at all cost.

Luckily the children are free to make good suggestions like these and not have to contend with the NRA, a group that has stopped all progress on gun control with their money and noise.






smileyhappy



Great.  Now liberals want laws to be written by pre-teens.  And, I’m not obsessed with Grover Norquist like you are.  Weird that you think about him so much though.






smileyhappy



I’m truly sorry you don’t like me.  Whatever will I do?  That’s a pretty violent reaction you have though.  You don’t want me in this world?  I guess its a good thing the nation is on the lookout for mentally unstable persons who wish to harm others right now.






jojo



And if a teacher had access to a gun they probably would have been able to save most in the school that day. Arm the teachers! You have but to look across the ocean and see who is armed in places like Africa, Middle East. Not the people. They are getting shot down in their villages and towns.






smileyhappy



Their money comes from millions of Americans who support them.  I could say that luckily my child is free to make good suggestions without having to contend with the DNC and Barack Obama, groups that stop all progress on things I care about with their money and noise.  Same thing.  The NRA isn’t a nameless, faceless, structure.  It’s people.  Millions and millions of people.

You can’t look anywhere on the news or internet without seeing the cries for more gun control in wake of last Friday’s massacre in Newtown, CT.   There is no escaping the tears of remorse and cries of anger that have flooded every media outlet in the nation.
But let’s set raw emotion aside for a second and look at reality.  First and foremost, the guns did NOT kill those children and adults in Connecticut, it was Adam Lanza.  The guns did not load themselves, it was Adam Lanza, and the guns did not pull the trigger, it was Adam Lanza.
It’s already a well-known fact that Connecticut had some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation, but Adam Lanza didn’t care about the law.  Some of the other areas of our nation that have the highest crime rates also have strict gun control laws, but laws rarely stop people that are determined to commit violent acts on other people.
So what is the solution?  How about taking a look at what works in other countries like Thailand and Israel.  Both countries have active terrorist threats against school children by Muslim extremists and Jihadists.  In an effort to prevent a similar shooting at their schools, they have been arming their teachers.  Many teachers in Israel and Thailand now carry concealed handguns with them.
The Israeli government told the people that they would protect them and they created gun-free zones in the country.  Those zones soon became known as victim disarmament zones.
In 1974, Jihadist terrorists attacked Israeli school children on a field trip to a tobacco farm.  The attack killed 25 and wounded 66 other.  In 1978, terrorists attacked an Israeli school bus, killing 37 children and wounding 76 other people.
Israeli people had enough of the gun free zones and failed promises of government protection.  Instead of tightening up gun control laws, they started arming teachers and others and trained them how to protect their students.
In 2002, Jihadists tried to enter an Israeli school, only to be repelled by armed teachers. In another incident, a suicide bomber that was intending on blowing himself up at an Israeli school was shot and killed by an armed teacher before he was able to detonate the bomb.
The threat of violence against school children is still high in Israel and Thailand, but we don’t hear nearly as many successful attacks being carried out since they started arming teachers.  Their programs have proven to be very successful and I believe we should implement the same thing here.  Let’s arm our teachers before we disarm the people.

You do not need to be a rocket scientist to figure out that 250m guns including 35m assault weapons and the self defeating notion of guns for self defence are absurd. Only in America or in third world religious fiefdoms do people need to perhaps think like a teabagger.

Tommy and all liberals have the brain of a ten year old. Tommy thought these children were insightful. They were nice and ignorant. They will get smarter when they grow up. When you grow up and you still think like that then you are just stupid.

After WWII the allied forced made the villagers close to the concentration camps go to them and see the carnage committed by their fellow citizens. They then were forced to clean them out, and bury the dead.
So all you gun masturbaters should be made to clean up the bodies after a massacre. Especially the young children riddled with bullets, then carry the bodies to the parents. You people make any decent person sick with your pathetic arguments that more people should have had guns. You should get off your video games and stop reading WND. Their is no conspiracy. The big bad government is not coming to get you.

I absolutely loathe Obama and his response today was disgusting but it’s horrible to interview children in this case. I hated it when the media put 7 yold’s on tv last week to describe the attack and I don’t like this, either. They have no business being used in this way, on either side of the argument.

Home school and you won’t have to worry about school shootings. Also your child will not be indoctrinated by left wing loons that push global warming and false science.

How did you arrive here?  How twisted and contorted is your thinking to somehow believe you could extrapolate any comparison between Nazi supporters and gun rights advocates.  I’m so tired of calling people names here as it really does not help in the conversation, but this is without a doubt, one of the most stupid comments I’ve yet to read in Mediaite.  And believe me, with the vast number of liberals here – that is really saying something.

So are you an arms dealer trolling the internet to peddle your BS, or what?
Here’s a look at arms and other ‘controlled’ products sold worldwide just from the UK…
http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/feb/22/uk-arms-sales-middle-east-north-africa#data
(Red is military sales which dwarfs general licensed sales in most countries)
Actually, you’ll be surprised the percentage of people in many countries of the middle east that are armed. (Not near the USA of course – We have almost double the #2 country – which is YEMEN! Now there’s a stat to be proud of, ha?)
Here is a GREAT link that shows gun ownership and gun homicide rates in every major country of the world…
http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/jul/22/gun-homicides-ownership-world-list
(Click the column header in any of the 7 columns to sort by that column data type.)
I hope this link gets passed around more over the next few weeks.(Thank you Guardian)
If you look at the list – and consider the overall civility and political climate of the nation – you’ll soon come to the obvious conclusion that the solution is not more guns, fool.

Wow, kids… First Katie and her pathetic attempt to foster ratings in the name of sharing a story and news.
Tommy… dude… low man… even for you. Let’s just stack those young bodies and use them as a platform for your agenda.
“Those memories, frozen in time, as precious and as hard as diamonds, will live forever in the hearts of everyone who hears them.”
…now everyone, lets just ban all guns and turn in the ones we have… for the children of course.
Pathetic, this is not the way to make policy in this or any country.

Since you don’t believe in guns how about Arm the teachers with at least wasp spray if they are reluctant to carry a gun. It shoots up to 30 ft. and puts quite a hurt on the person sprayed. If the Newtown principal had had something other than her own body to lunge at the perpetrator, who knows how much less damage he could have wrought.

Load of C-ap , Australia finally got sick of mass shootings in 1996 and passed serious reforms, they haven’t had a mass shooting since. Start with banning semi’s [and you know what a mean, military style capacity weapons]  high c mags, real backgound checks not this half-assed 24 hour underfunded  data base, stop gun show and internet sales, no teflons or other anti personal ammo, large purchases of ammo should be registered, and how bout some universal health care to include mental health exams.

You probably cannot define what an assault weapon is.

1. Chambered to an intermediate cartridge.
2. Detachable box magazine. Belt fed firearms are typically referred to as machine-guns, not assault rifles.
3. Capable of selective fire.

y Premise: firearm regulations do not have a notable effect on the
annual per capita rate of firearm homicides around the world or in the
United States.
Supporting fact 1: Some nations and states with stringent gun control
laws have comparatively higher per capita firearm homicide rates.
Supporting fact 2: Some nations and states with stringent gun control
laws have comparatively lower per capita firearm homicide rates.
Supporting fact 3: Some nations and states with minimal gun control laws
have comparatively higher per capita firearm homicide rates.
Supporting fact 4: Some nations and states with minimal gun control laws
have comparatively lower per capita firearm homicide rates.
My Conclusion: Firearm regulations are inconsequential regarding the
annual per capita rate of firearm homicides in the United States and
around the world.
The solution is neither more guns or less guns, but rather empathy for one’s fellow man.

A perfect example of the stupidity I’m referring to. As a law enforcement officer, I have none of the fantasies you speak of – a firearm to me is just another tool. And as with many tools, placed in the wrong hands, they are capable of inflicting lots of damage. This is the thing you liberals who fear firearms will never understand. You focus so much attention on the weapon, but fail to even offer an explanation as to the why – what possesses these people?  What inner demons drive young people to commit mass murder?  Do you not think someone, hell bent on killing lots of people cannot possibly reach for other methods to fullfill their murderous desires?






Ian Kable



As a radical libertarian, I adamantly disagree.
They have every right to a means of defending themselves from tyranny, whether it exists or not. However, if tyranny suddenly presents itself and you don’t have a means of defending yourself, the tyrant will hardly allow you to arm yourself. Then it’s off to the ovens like boxcars full of cattle.

I’ve always felt it’s more a cultural thing than anything else. 
And IMO there’s plenty wrong with “American Culture” – starting with the ever-increasing  acceptance of graphical gore and violence that was allowed to creep into our  “entertainment” – and our heads-in-the sand ignorance and stigmatizing of mental illness. Couple that with an obsession and glorification of war, the chest-pounding “cowboy mentality” that has long been entrenched in many parts of the country, a growing political divide breeding ignorance and intolerance – and you have everything needed for incidents like last Friday to become commonplace.
So I agree – it’s not just guns. The whole picture needs a re-framing. We need to reflect and “fix” ourselves, before we are beyond repair.

I own several guns, and shot competitively when I was younger, but I have struggled with this issue professionally for quite a while; advising families of the increased danger of having a firearm in the home is a standard practise. Statistics bear out that a firearm in the home makes it far more likely (ten to fifteen times) that a domestic violence incident will turn deadly, that a child will be killed by accident or incident, and that those under psychological distress will make the decision in a moment to use that firearm. 
Ignoring the statistics won’t make them go away; we need to set aside our reflexive defences and come together to find a solution to the rate of gun crime in the US. Other countries have the same cultural pressures and entertainment options without the high rates of firearms deaths. Responsible gun owners must lead the conversation and not listen to the voices saying that nothing can or should be done.

My thoughts and prayers are with the families while they grieve but taking guns away from law abiding citizens is CRAZY!  Just look to Chicago where they have the country’s most strict gun laws.  In 2012 alone there have been 446 school age children shot in Chicago.  How is that gun control working out?

We have gun control laws. Their was no failure of any law on the books.
Their was a failure of an individual to follow any one of the many laws he broke.
Referring to any party as the ‘enemy’ will only serve to further divide this country at a time when we need all hands working together to solve the many complex issues.

Judging from the way Congress runs the country, I’d say the laws currently are being written by pre-teens.
Grover and his no new taxes will go the way of Reagan and Bush Sr.’s no new taxes.  When you spend too much you have to cut expenses and get a second job.  The American tax payer is the second job.

Look up the stats on the UK, Switzerland, Russia, and Mexico.
Of these countries two have very stringent firearm regulations, two have very minimalist firearms regulations, two have very low annual per capita firearm homicides, and two have very high per capita firearm related homicides. 
Each country is unique regarding how stringent its regulations are and how high its firearm related homicides are.






Ian Kable



That’s precisely how I see it.
But that’s not what is going to happen. The progressives will ban auto-loading firearms across the board and another mass shooting will occur in about 5 years.
That’s what happened with the 94 ban and Columbine in 99.
They refuse to learn from the mistakes of history, that’s why they are progressives

My previous post pretty much outlined everything I consider to be “part of the problem”.
And you find something wrong with ‘the musket argument’? You really believe the founding fathers envisioned a general population armed with the kind of weapons that are ‘street legal’ today?
 Times change my friend, and the Constitution was written with that in mind – allowing for ‘the people’ to change the laws to fit the needs of the time via their representation in Congress.
 Any argument for a strict interpretation of the Constitution and Bill of Rights, as written, is as valid as insisting a fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible should be the law of the land in 2012. And just like the Bible, people tend to pick and choose verses, interpret them to their desire, use that interpretation to justify a belief or forward a narrative, while ignoring many other verses that have long become outdated and irrelevant to the modern era.
 The problem with quoting or insisting on a strict interpretation of either the Constitution or the Bible is that they were both written by man, and the interpretations changed by man through the years – to override the original intent of much of it, to the point that it is impossible for any intelligent person to respect every one of today’s current interpretations as ‘gospel’. For example, how many of the thousands of decisions made by the SCOTUS through the years do you believe were a correct interpretation of the original intent of our founding fathers? We’ll never know, will we? And even if you believe you know what the intent was, you should respect the fact that the founding fathers intended their verbiage to be revisited as written, and amended as needed through time.
 It’s not perfect, and those amendments or interpretation by the ever-changing courts  are never perfect – but the U.S. Constitution still remains one of the best documents ever written, to provide a system of fundamental laws and principles that prescribes the nature, functions, and limits of a government. And the best anyone can, or should do – if they truly believe in the original intent of our founding fathers – is go with the times and accept change as an inevitable part of this great federal republic.

Another liberal calling me a liar?  Your statistics are not even close to being accurate.  These unions, lobby groups and law enforcement agencies you speak of do NOT speak for the great majority of law enforcement officers who believe in the right of honest, law abiding citizens to own firearms.  As a member of the Law Enforcement Alliance of America (http://www.leaa.org/) I do not fear the responsible gun owner and find laughable your assertion that the ‘official position’ of law enforcement is to control weapons.  Clearly, you have no idea of what you are talking about.  And please, spare me the sure to follow links of law enforcement agencies from liberal northeast and northwest areas who advocate large scale weapon confiscation – I’ve read them all.

While I agree that Kids need more exposure to mental health treatments, because the pressures on Kids in high schools and colleges grows ever more intense, it is very poor form to assert that the growing gun issue is due to mental illness, there is no science to prove it and it unfairly taints swathes of people with all sorts of mental issues. Secondly I agree that you can not get 250m guns to disappear, but you can a) get 35m assault weapons to disappear b) reduce the rest c) use taxation to raise additional revenue from Gun sales and Gun owners in order to both fund greater access to mental counselling and motivate gun relinquishment d) via education and NYC type policing techniques create more environments where owning guns for personal protection becomes more self evidently infantile.

I’ve never been one to say that nothing should or can be done to curb gun violence – never.  But a legalized gun grab is certainly not the answer, particularly when so many criminals have embraced firearms as the weapon of choice.  I know it’s been turned into something of a cliche’ but the fact remains: If voluntary surrender of firearms is ever called for, you will turn law abiding citizens into ‘criminals’ as I believe a majority will never cede what has been for the last 200 plus years, their constitutionally protected right.  You will also not see the firearms from the predators and criminals who will now find a land filled with victims, ripe for the taking.  What is the answer? We’ve looked at the NRA and other groups that stress gun ownership as the devil, pointing fingers at blame in their direction yet never hold accountable the judges, prosecutor’s offices, and state/federal corrections departments that pay lip service to sentencing guidelines for these violent offenders.






dstouffermd



How would a voluntary surrender or buyback programme turn people into criminals if it is voluntary? 
As a law enforcement officer, you should have an abundance of ideas to tackle the issue. Since about 90% of murders of 4-or-more occur with legally-purchased weapons, we can’t say that more weapons is the answer. There are many answers that start with funding such a buyback programme. These have been quite successful at the local level, and could be on a national level if funded. And truthfully, setting aside the money to purchase back millions of firearms is cost-effective as it frees up enforcement, medical, and judicial system funds. (Studies have people most likely to desire to participate in such programmes are also the most likely to have their firearms stolen or misused.) Ammunition regulation and tracking is another constitutionally-permissible remedy that is effective in countries that have relatively high (for the world, not compared to the US) gun ownership and low gun crime. Also, more states could follow the lead of existing Federal law and decrease judicial discretion in sentencing for gun crimes. The gun show loophole can be tightened if not closed, which will cut down on straw purchasing and avoidance of background checks. Limits on numbers of guns purchased per month will do the same thing. There are technological advances that can also be made, from the background check systems to the level of individual weapons and ammo. 
These are just a few ideas, none of which are enough or perfect, but are ideas that have been endorsed by local, state, and federal associations of the criminal justice system. And these are just the gun-specific ideas I could think of in ten minutes; medical, financial, and educational issues can be addressed, as well. No one in the national discussion is proposing eliminating gun rights or taking back guns involuntarily. But there are voices saying that this is the price we pay for having “the mostly benevolent protection of the Second Amendment”, and that we should just further build up the number of guns in the country. And that is not an argument that I’m welcoming without resistance any longer.
Cheers, mate, and stay safe.

I don’t know where your previous post is in this very long thread. That being said I STILL don’t know what you think about pshyc-drugs because you did not answer my question. 
You also still focus on guns and not anything else. 
I agree with you about the constitution and never said that it should not evolve. However the document is not that ambiguous and is not written in parables and metaphor like the Bible so that is not an apples to apples comparison. But lets leave the Bible out of this.
When the Constitution was written the 2nd amd was written to enable the people to defend themselves from all types of tyranny, foreign or domestic. Back then the Musket Gun WAS the highest tech weapon ever created. So yes they did want us to be on equal footing with the power of our Gov. 
Do I think that we should have Rocket launchers ect. Not totally against it but I am not dumb and do see the dangers in that. The thing is that the Gov has all the resources and will always have superior weaponry. So to combat that we the people need to keep as much of our guns as possible. I believe THAT is what our Fore Fathers intended.
This was a horrible tragedy and we can not just blame the guns for this. Yet those who crave power (not you) are using this to weaken the people.

neil enbob has been banned and mediaite continue to assert bullying will not be tolerated.
btw – if someone calls you names because you stood up for someone else who was being bullied – wear it as your red medal of honor. neil enbob has problems and he used someones weight to viciously attack that person.
my question is – where were the rest of you – you all saw the bullying happen – but you did nothing – that is cowardly to the millionth degree.
neil can call me any name he wants – because i will always stand up to the bully, and i will always protect the bullied. and if i catch you bullying i will win. 
my work here is finished.
on to the next troll.

my statistics are accurate – every law enforcement agency in the country supports gun control.
this is a fact.
i never mentioned the right to own firearms – i mentioned gun control – please either stay on topic or dont comment – but hedging is beneath you

oh come on – the comment was absurd – it wasnt logical, doable, or even likely to gain any support. its reducto ad absurdum.

a white supremacist – i thought you lot were a dying breed – embarrassed, sad, nazist, pathetic, yet here you are with no self awareness claiming to support such pathetic notions.

well lol whatever – the guy simply was using words he did not understand the meaning of.

you couldnt define fickle and whimsy! so here you are pointing to someone else’s lack of word comprehension? now that is funny.
seriously you tried to call tyrants fickle (obviously tyranny itself is mutually exclusive to fickleness) and when caught u tried to substitute whimsy for fickle. which not only didnt make sense, it suggested you were trying to be cleverer than you actually are – and you got caught, tried to cover up the first error by making another even more egregious error.
until your own comprehension is sufficient to not have this happen – how about you lay off calling out others for theirs.






    http://twitter.com/palmerkiss                            palmer kiss



was fickle and whimsy floating around in there also? ian you stole that information, and seriously you need to rethink this method of commenting.

If I was joining the army I would be interested in the Army giving me the definition – for all other scenarios it is clear the definition is interchangeable, and thus the dictionary will do me fine. 
But getting any type of wisdom from an NRA advocate is an oxymoron. If I had any friends that felt the need for an assault weapon (by any of the various definitions) for personal protection – then such friendship would be short lived.

keep telling yourself i am the pathetic one – and keep responding to people with violent rhetoric – its fine with me – but i will hold you accountable for it.

I can comment on two Countries. Neither UK nor Switzerland has a gun problem relative to the USA (but the Swiss do have a few more deaths than the UK for obvious reasons)
But the Swiss have high Gun ownership for a better more logical cultural reason than the US. For the Swiss, being a neutral Country and thus by definition having no allies, it was mandated that each Citizen must be able to help protect the nation in the event of an attack..The US Motivation is far more selfish and childish and out of date  – going back to 1791. The Swiss motivation is far more honorable and although it might be argued that it is out of date, the fear was legitimate through at least 1944.






    http://twitter.com/andendall                            M Beall



By definition progressives learn from History were as Conservative want to relive History. Hence a progressive can learn about the Cultural differences between the USA, Switzerland and and the UK easily figure out the dynamic and act accordingly. I have explained the Swiss anomaly elsewhere.

You are an emotional child incapable of logical thought. Or so it seems.






Anonymous



You can’t seem to follow direction, or you just like to fight on the internet. Logic would entail calling the ideas of a child “naive” instead of “stupid.” 
 Dead children may be nothing but a statistic to you, but they aren’t to me.  I apologize to your sensibilities that I care about human life and am sensitive to the fact that being young is different than being stupid.  Now, kindly converse with your friend Gordon Bloyer about taking away non conservatives’ 2nd Amendment Rights and arming teachers with bazookas.

LOGICAL????  REALLY??!?!?!
Dude…I have 6 kids ranging in age from 21 to 4 and logical is not what comes to mind.

There are approximately 2.5 mil instances where guns are used to thwart criminal activity per year.  These are not my numbers, but numbers from a study funded by the Clinton administration.  Just because you think it does not make it so.

Would you stop being a tool!!!!
http://jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell121812.php3#.UNPp6ra7M-I
Even when the UK had similar laws to the US, their gun homicide rates were much lower than ours.  Comparing countries gets messy because of cultural differences.  You can’t LOGICALLY make those comparisons.

Lay off the weed bro. I would cut back your intake to at least once a week max. You didn’t comprehend anything I put down, if you did you would not have repeated your false accusation that I don’t care about the families. You just proved my last point, over emotional.






Anonymous



Here’s what I comprehend: You proposed an argument to use logic and rationality over emotion in evaluating “this situation” in response to a comment I posted to Gordon Bloyer about being sensitive to the surviving victims of the shooting.  
You then proceeded to call me a bunch of descriptors which all basically meant childishly emotional, and you called me a pot-head for some inexplicable reason.  I said you had no heart, and judging by your comment history, you don’t.  
You’re also beautifully ironically hypocritical when you use arguments based on emotion (name-calling) to deride someone for being emotional.  Glass houses and stones, bro.
Now, go find someone else to troll.






Anonymous



Your comment history is inaccurate. I don’t “name call” I tell the truth based on what is in front of me. Also, I do not hit pople with that untill I am backed into a wall. I repeatedly told you that I do feel for the victims and sugested that they should be left alone to grieve but you would’nt hear it. SO since you were blindly being illogical and personal I decided to give you a taste of your own medicine. Biter tasting isn’t it.
When it comes to these types of tragedies we need to keep a level head and not make knee jerk decisions to change policy.






    http://twitter.com/andendall                            M Beall



How many are gun on Gun. Now I am going to say something that will be totally alien to most Americans – but shooting some one even in self defence, unless perhaps that person was waving a gun or a obvious deadly  object. Zimmerman is a murderer end of story. Even if an unarmed mob comes to burgle your home – you should not be allowed to shoot them.
This whole every one must have a gun business must be stopped. No I realize what I am proposing is a bit unfair on the victim whilst we have such an absurd lack of Gun controls – so it is a chicken and egg situation – but the trend must be to disarm not double down. Americans have gotten themselves in a real bind by being trapped by the 2nd amendment, and the NRA has become a vile organisation.  So the solution to that is either to change the second amendment or only allow the type of arms that were available back in 1791.
30 years ago most emerging new Countries were quite keen to incorporate at least parts of the US Constitution into their own evolving constitutions, but today  no Country is interested, because the US constitution is universally seen as a very backward approach, made worse by a bunch of prejudiced misogynist old farts on the supreme Court. 
This calcification was something the Founding fathers thought likely to happen within a generation.

“progressives learn from history”?! LMAO! Yet you continue to champion the murderous and continual failures of socialism! What a crock. “Progressives”, or collectivists, have been responsible for more deaths than any other ideology in history. Just ask the millions of dead in Cambodia. And now you want the Obama regime fresh from delivering full auto assault rifles to Mexican drug cartels who murdered hundreds of Mexican nationals, teenagers and don’t forget a couple of our own Border Patrol officers, to “control guns”? Yeah, good luck with that. bwahahah!






    http://twitter.com/JudgeDredd2                            Judge Joe Dredd



Poor Cleve… as much as you’re desperate to change reality to fit your own twisted take, it’s just not going to work. The 2nd Amendment was written specifically to protect America from the tyranny of ignorant people like yourself. It was written to tell the government (and the statists who dream of controlling us) what it can NOT do. What part of “shall not be infringed” do you not understand? Even the SCOTUS understands this. YOU don’t get to change it without due process and that ain’t gonna happen. Deal with it. The truth is that you and the other Donks do not care about saving lives. You care about controlling them. And because of that, you will always fail.

There are 77 DEAD NORWEGIANS who would call you a liar to your face if they could. What you want is called a Police State and the Nazis would be very proud of you.

Dude…you don’t bring a knife to a gun fight (unless you have the element of surprise, which conceal carry gives us by the way).  I did not say that ~2.5 mil people drew firearms a fired, I said they were used.  Could be a simple as a show of force.  The same study included interviews with criminals in prison and it showed that they were more afraid of finding an armed citizen than being caught by the police.  
I’m not saying that we all need guns, but I am saying that advertizing “Gun Free Zones” is ignorant.  I’m am not a fan of open carry…concealed carry is a much better deterrent.
I always find it fascinating that pro gun control people believe that passing a law for some sort of disarmament is somehow going to get criminals to disarm.  THEY ARE CRIMINALS….BREAKING LAWS IS WHAT THEY DO!!!!  These policies only put more citizens at risk.  The only way disarmament could possibly work is if you have a complete and total prohibition of all civilian arms, but that will go down worse than the prohibition of alcohol did.  Speaking of prohibition…are you pro marijuana legalization?  The discussion is similar to gun control, which I also find fascinating as many who are pro pot legalization are pro gun control.
Your comments on the Constitution only prove to me how poor our education system has become.

You don’t belong here if you can’t accept President Obama as President of the USA.

Okay, troll: I think we pretty much got the place to ourselves now so let’s
roll.
I do not hit pople with that untill I am backed into a wall.
First off, “pople.”  Second, I backed you into a wall?  You don’t hit “pople” with that?  Just how pathetic a person are you?  Seriously.
I repeatedly told you that I do feel for the victims and sugested that they should be left alone to grieve but you would’nt hear it
I wouldn’t hear it because the toothpaste is out the can, man.  Did you think this was an “imaginary” article about the victims being interviewed, or did you just not bother to read the article before commenting? 
I decided to give you a taste of your own medicine. Biter tasting isn’t it.
I imagined you crying as you typed that, and I love the taste of tears.  Especially do as I say not as I do tears.
PS– You are a sh!tty speller.

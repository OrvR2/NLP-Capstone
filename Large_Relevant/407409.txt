4daysagoRussia Bolshoi Ballet acid victim: I forgive my attackerBy Steve Gutterman, ReutersYuri Kadobnov / AFP - Getty Images, fileAn April 2011 photo shows Sergei Filin, artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet, as he looked before an attacker threw acid in his face in Moscow on Friday. MOSCOW -- The artistic director of Russia's Bolshoi Ballet says he has forgiven the attacker who splashed acid in his face and has pledged to return to the stage.His head shaven and a bandage around his neck, Sergei Filin told a Russian television station from his hospital room that he was determined to return to work despite his injuries.Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economyFilin, 42, suffered severe burns during the attack on his way home from the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow late on Jan. 18. Doctors have performed two operations on each eye and hope to save his sight.

"I am not going to lie. Of course it is very hard for me and very difficult," Filin said in grainy footage in a video-link with NTV television late on Sunday."I tell myself every morning when I wake up: 'Sergei, you are healthy, everything is in its place -- your arms, your legs.' ... And I will do everything to go back to being the same Sergei I was before."Filin did not wear the thick bandages that had swathed his head and face in mobile phone footage taken the day after the attack, but his eyes were half-closed and it was unclear whether he could see.Filin's job gave him the power to make or break careers at the ballet, which is an enduring symbol of Russian culture. He said after the attack that he had been receiving threats."A priest came to me, and I told him: 'You know, I forgive everyone, and God will be their judge. Because people are weak,'" he said. "I forgive all the people who are involved in this."He said he did not know who was behind the attack but made clear he believed that it was related to his work."Before somehow satisfying their ambitions or quenching the pain of resentment ... it would be truly good if they would just think about the fact that I have three remarkable sons," Filin said."Even if the worst happens, I will continue to look upon this world, and I will continue to do what I do -- but it will be through the eyes of my three sons."Russia's top eye doctor told Reuters last week that Filin would retain at least some vision in each eye."I promise, you will see me on stage," Filin said.Copyright 2013 Thomson Reuters.

If 'Forgive' means taking a 2x4 and bashing them up one side and down the other!1 vote#35 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:22 PM ESTMAH29Acid tossing appears to be a tactic of Islamic extremists . Russia has it's own problems with Islam. A male ballet dance would be a target for a lot of reasons to them.  Art is something that must be suppressed in Islam.1 vote#36 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:22 PM ESTpulsar182Music and ballet are UN-Islamic...1 vote#36.1 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:35 PM ESTpulsar182Hadith Qudsi 19:5: "The Prophet said that Allah commanded him to destroy all the musical instruments, idols, crosses and all the trappings of ignorance." (The Hadith Qudsi, or holy Hadith, are those in which Muhammad transmits the words of Allah, although those words are not in the Qur'an.)
Muhammad also said:
(1) "Allah Mighty and Majestic sent me as a guidance and mercy to believers and commanded me to do away with musical instruments, flutes, strings, crucifixes, and the affair of the pre-Islamic period of ignorance."
(2) "On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will pour molten lead into the ears of whoever sits listening to a songstress."
(3) "Song makes hypocrisy grow in the heart as water does herbage."
(4) "This community will experience the swallowing up of some people by the earth, metamorphosis of some into animals, and being rained upon with stones." Someone asked, "When will this be, O Messenger of Allah?" and he said, "When songstresses and musical instruments appear and wine is held to be lawful."
(5) "There will be peoples of my Community who will hold fornication, silk, wine, and musical instruments to be lawful ...." -- 'Umdat al-Salik r40.01 vote#36.2 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:39 PM ESTbigdogmom1@Pulsar - we have to remember that not only do Islamics reject music, there are several "fundamentalist" Christian religions in America the also do not allow music or dancing.  While I am not up on my religion, I believe one of them is a super strict Baptist sect.
That said, you had a very interseting post - I never knew about the Islamic ban on music.3 votes#36.3 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 4:13 PM ESTPBgeorgia99I don't think the article was about islam, music, or the muslim holy book.. The article clearly states that the man thinks the attack had something to do with his work. NOT ISLAM.  Let's try not to de-rail here. 1 vote#36.4 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 4:32 PM ESTgramgigiI would be a bit worried since they haven't found who did it. He should think about his kids safety too. Glad he is not letting this awful attack stop him.1 vote#37 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:24 PM ESTBetter MotherI'm glad that he looked passed the hate that was intended to end him, hate is very powerful, it can destroy the best of people, I wish him a safe recovery.#38 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:25 PM ESTScott SwaineI hope this guy can make a full and proper recovery from his injury, but as far as "forgiving"... 
This is where all the pacifist crap in the world comes from, and why our laws never get enforced, and why more and more people are made victim...too many of you wimps out there "forgive" everything, so the perps go free to do it again.  If fewer of you forgave such acts as this, more people would be too afraid to do it in the first place, because the laws would actually have some TEETH in them and PROSECUTE the criminals.
Maybe his personal conscious might feel better by forgiving, but it doesn't solve the underlying problem society has with crimes like this.1 vote#39 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:38 PM ESTbigdogmom1@Scott -forgiveness does not trump justice.  They are two different things and Sergei never said he didn't want his attackers (if found) tried and punished.  His forgiveness was merely to set his mind free to go on with his life and not be eaten up inside with hate.  I would just bet he wants justice.1 vote#39.1 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 4:17 PM ESTjimpyIt was a mob hit.  Someone who was very disgruntled paid professionals to maim him - think the horse head in the bed scene from The Godfather.  Clearly some influential party felt wronged by Sergei and paid to punish him.  If the Russians love their ballet as much as we've been told, they'll find the person(s) responsible and justice will prevail.  He's a better man than I...forgive?  That would be pretty tough...#40 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:41 PM EST

Where would Palistine and Israel be if they were so 'Christ like'?  I guess that's why there is continual bloodshed and hate there, because neither Palestine or Israel follows Christ.  I am very, very angry with my soon to be ex-wife and her 'boyfriend', and I would like nothing more than to vent that hurt and anger on him at least for ruining our 25 year marriage, but reading this reminds me that 'vengeance is Mine, says the Lord', and I'll let it go and take the High Road.  Thank you Sergie, for being a Real Man and leading me by example.  #48 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 4:05 PM ESTBuffarillaIf everyone believed this the world would have as many people left as dinosaurs2 votes#48.1 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 4:08 PM ESTPaul L.I feel really sorry for you buffarilla.

I curse the people who did this and pray that God's judgment befalls them quickly.  I pray that Sergei's vision and face are restored.  I pray that he can continue doing his work soon and wish him a speedy recovery.  This must have been a terrifying ordeal for him. #52 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 4:59 PM ESTSteve62461I blame the acid !!!!  The Russians need to take our governments lead and push for limts and control on acid and by all means don't blame the person that threw the acid.  That darn acid is trying to imitate exactly what guns do in our country and that is it just comes to life by itself.  See this guy needs to forgive the acid, he's got it all wrong.  Am I right ye almighty sheep ??????? 1 vote#53 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 5:09 PM ESTFERNDOCHey Steve, there you have it, BAN ACID, problem solved!  Hmmm--- but then only acid-throwers will have acid--- but hey, its the thought that counts.  Shucks, we tried---#53.1 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 5:27 PM ESTBr. CurtI wish I could say I have the character and spiritual strength that Sergei has!  He's truly a remarkable human being.  I pray for your complete healing and that the person(s) responsible be brought to justice.  They will have to continue to live with what they have done.  I pray they will realize the terrible wrong they have done and that they will seek forgivness.  If not, they are destroying their live and the man they wished to destroy is becoming a stronger and better man. #54 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 5:10 PM ESTsmarty1can you say Alibi...I think he needs to let everyone know including the media hes taking a trip out of town.2 votes#55 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 5:18 PM ESTterryvmclWhat an extraordinary man you are. I will keep you in my prayers for a complete recovery of your vision and the future surgeries you will endure. May God bless you and your family. You are a real hero in the eyes of many in a very cruel world.#56 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 5:23 PM ESTDee-1269917I use to think that forgiving those who trespass against us was the way to go. However, in light of our current society I really don't think it helps the victims of crimes to do so, it only helps their attackers. To forgive is making the victim re-visit and be victimized again. If he can forgive than i wish him all the best. I myself would not be able to do so.  1 vote#57 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 5:24 PM EST

DogDancerSuch an appalling and wicked thing to have thrown acid upon this talented man, Sergei Filin, who has spent a lifetime devoted to his art and craft. Sergei, the world hopes that your recovery is swift and as complete as possible. As to the villain who did this: Your time of reckoning will come, and most of us here, hope that it is soon and on this earthly plane. #58 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 7:13 PM ESTJump to discussion page: 1 2 3Leave a Comment:Name: Email Address (will be verified, but never shown): You're in Easy Mode.

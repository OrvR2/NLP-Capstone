Don't ask for something and expect only the benefits.. I'm a feminist, and being a man I get shit alllllll the time for standing up against equality﻿ toward females.. But I deal with the humiliation and mockery because its what I believe is right, so if a women is going to confront an animalistic male, about equality then sadly, you better be ready to take a hit and press charges as a man, not a women.. No special treatment both ways.

This is why I adhere to the values in the Bible. If only everyone listens to the Bible and does not misapplies what it says, the world will not be full of discrimination. I respect men and women, should they be my oppressors or my friends.
I experience a lot of venomous negativities from men, their style is very different from the﻿ bullying I receive from women. Both men and women can be discriminating. If only the world shows love and respect... :(

Paul's words were often misunderstood and often used as a proof of the Bible antifemale bias. Now let us see if Paul was really against womankind.
In 1 Timothy 5:1, 2, Paul said: “Do not severely criticize an older man. To the contrary, entreat him﻿ as a father, younger men as brothers, older women as mothers, younger women as sisters with all chasteness.” Are those not words of respect for womankind? (to be continued)

Consider Galatians 3:28 where Paul said that "there is neither male nor female; for you are all one person in union with Christ Jesus." Or
what about his words regarding marital intimacies that﻿ you can read from 1 Corinthians 7:3, 4?
Paul is not really against women. What, then, does he mean on 1 Timothy 2:12? Did his advocacy of womanly “silence” stem from an antifemale bias? No! The “silence” called for was in relation to teaching and exercising spiritual authority in the congregation.

That is why women are not allowed to conduct spiritual meetings where there are capable and annointed men who can do so. This does not mean that women cannot be teachers of divine truth. Paul encouraged older women to be “teachers of what is good” to younger women. In following the example of Eunice﻿ and Lois, who instructed Timothy, Christian mothers are to train their children in godly ways.
I am not a female pastor, I don't know the English word for that. But I preach the truth from Bible.

It is an arrangement of God. It is not a proof that the Bible advocates discrimination against women. The﻿ only reason why some use the Bible to discriminate others is because they misunderstood the part that they read or simply misapplied it. Careful examination of the Bible is really important, Mr. SmashJohn. I hope you understand. Thank you.

Under the Law given by God to Israel, women had many privileges and were free to use their initiative. God's laws provided through Moses gave women full opportunity to grow spiritually. In the first century C.E., God-fearing﻿ women were privileged to minister to Jesus. For a time after Pentecost 33 C.E., Christian women were favored with the gifts of the spirit. They spoke in foreign languages and prophesied, not necessarily making predictions but speaking forth Scriptural truths. (to be cont)

But a Christian man has a divinely assigned role and is expected to fill it. Paul stated: “I want you to know that the head of every man is the Christ;﻿ in turn the head of a woman is the man; in turn the head of the Christ is God.” (1 Corinthians 11:3) Man too has a head—the Christ. Indeed, man is accountable to Christ and ultimately to God. And God expects man to exercise his headship lovingly. (Ephesians 5:25) This has been so ever since humans first walked the earth.

As Head of the Christian congregation, Jesus “gave gifts in men.” (Ephesians 1:22; 4:7-13) When listing the qualifications for overseers, Paul refers to men. (1 Timothy 3:1-7; Titus 1:5-9).
Women enjoy priveleges in the congregation, except teaching in the congregation, meaning to say, heading a congregation meeting. That is what you can read on 1 Timothy 2:12. Because the assignment is given to﻿ men, not to women. It's simply an arrangement.

This does not mean that a woman is to be completely silent at a meeting of the Christian congregation. She is to be silent in the sense of not getting into disputes with a man. She is not to belittle his appointed position or endeavor to teach the congregation. Men have been given﻿ the assignment of presiding over and teaching the congregation, but women add much to Christian meetings by participating in them in various ways. (end)

Guys are not superior, I've yet to see a man give birth, breast feed, menstruated and menopause... But on the same line women are not superior to man.. We as humans are equal, and should be treated as exactly that.. A women can be just as masculine and men can be equally feminine.. My ONLY dislike is women﻿ who preach equality and equal rights, but still abuse the "victim card" when treated like a man. Double standards are wrong

For everyone who continues to say this is sexist against men, please educate yourselves:Sexism is prejudice or discrimination based on sex;﻿ behavior, conditions, or attitudes that foster stereotypes of social roles based on sex.These lyrics do not include anything prejudicial or discriminatory about men. The entire song is focused on acknowledging the power that women hold and empowering them to use it to achieve something for themselves. She mentions men should not disrespect women. That's all.

I'm not sexist at all. I think both sexes are equal. I do not, however, take kindly to people expressing a belief that we are not. I know exactly what you're trying to imply with that quote, but you're not going to get anywhere. Sperm is both physically small, and in the overall scheme of procreation, it is little. It kickstarts the process, but women do the rest. It's a 30/70 situation. Which is what I was referring to. I called spunk﻿ 'little' and you've used a slur... hmm, wonder who's sexist?

Um. You realize this text, right? However you read it, is based upon what emotions you bring to the table unless I explicitly use language that is dictionary-definition demeaning or derogatory. Which I have not. 'Spunk' is not derogatory, it is simply a colloquialism. You, sir, should move﻿ on. We are at an impasse, but I hope you have learned the difference between empowerment and true sexism.

In the context of what you said it IS derogatory.'Your little spunk' irrevocably implies irrelevance and of no worth, but also an ignorance based attitude to the fact that it is actually a single sperm that﻿ 'kickstarts' this process, not 'spunk'.

Actually, it isn't. Read the rest of that sentence, sir. I expressed it was not responsible﻿ for the entire process that procreation entails in response to a comment that implied otherwise in an inflammatory way. As for my intelligence level on the science—I am well aware that it is a single sperm is responsible for conception. You implying that I am not is insulting, and shows you're out of relevant arguments. Are you aware that 'spunk' is the fluid that sperm exists in and is an umbrella term?

That line of discussion is completely irrelevant, I will agree with you on that. I, however, am not sexist. You would understand that if you existed in my personal life, but alas, you do not. But everything you have said to other folks has suggested you are sexist to a certain degree, some of it﻿ blatant, some of it more subtle. I don't take fault with any of the subtle hints, those are a product of society, you're right on that too. You seem like a decent person, let's agree to disagree.

Mr. Sam10947, I understand what you mean. But what I think Ms. Wright wants to say is that even though man and woman are not the same, they are equal. Equal in a sense that both man and woman complement each other. And that none is either superior or inferior. Thus, both male and female should﻿ be treated equally under the law.
Women in other cultures are oppressed. This is not right and very very sexist.

Hello everyone! :)
I'm a rapper from North Carolina
I'm 20 years old and I've been writing and recording for about two years
I work extremely hard on my lyrics and flow, but it’s very hard to get views
and nothing gets me more hyped than making music. It’s my passion!
It would make my day if one of you could come﻿ through and listen?
Maybe you'll like it maybe not, but at least a view is what I'm hoping for..
Could you please help me along the road with a Big THUMBS UP?
Thank you all!!

Okay guys, please just read this. I know nobody will probably see this but I am hoping to get someone's attention. I myself do music & have a dream of having people support me and idolize me but it is hard for me because a lot of people are judgmental. I﻿ mean I know I am not a skater boy or a Justin Bieber look a like, heck not even a boy, but I would appreciate anybody viewing & possibly subscribing/commenting. It would mean so much to me! Thanks to who all has read this.

This song is sexist. Reverse the gender.."who runs the world boys/men" and you would have general outcry.﻿

It's not sexist at all. It's empowering. We very clearly live in a world where men think they have all the power. Whether that's consciously or subconsciously, or both, is arguable, but it's true. When in reality, women hold a lot more power than they realize or are given credit for. If she was saying 'men are terrible and screw up everything' then that﻿ would be sexist.

And you would be completely and entirely wrong. Just because you are female does not automatically give your complete absence of﻿ an argument validation. Clearly you have some issues understanding higher concepts if you think the correct way to approach a counter-argument is to address me by 'bitch' for no reason. Go look up the definition of sexism, maybe read some articles on its existence, and then come talk to me.

Are you kidding me? That's not even a valid argument in any way, shape, or form. Let me remind you that﻿ your 'God' did not write the bible. Men wrote the bible to reflect whatever the hell they wanted- and that has always been to promote their own power and keep women down. There's a reason women had to fight for the right to attend school, attend higher education, vote. We have systematically been characterized as less by men since the beginning of recorded history. And that simply isn't true.

Are you unaware of the fact that women are in the military and are in direct combat? Women do not require men﻿ to take care of them, contrary to what you believe. We're cable of making millions, controlling companies, serving in the military, raising families, advancing technology, and so much more. And we've done it, and will continue you to do it regardless of idiots like yourself. So why don't you just STFU, and try not to procreate. We don't need more of your ignorance spreading.

Females can never lead army's, and simply because it is a MANS job to﻿ do so, there are things that women can never do simply because it would disrespect a MANS pride, e.g In my culture (Maori) women cannot do a haka because it is disrespectful to do so, women should should just know there fucking place!

That's hilarious! Women cannot do﻿ certain things because it would HURT your PRIDE? Not because they're incapable. Wow, and who in that scenario is weak, then? You're just proving my point. If you want respect, you earn it by giving it. Honestly, I'm laughing right now at how perfectly your response proves my point. You might also want to check your facts on females not leading armies. There's many countries in the world where that's exactly what happens.

And that's where you're wrong. We are not inferior.﻿ You cannot do something better simply based on the fact you have a different sex organ. If we were to compare our lives, our intelligence, and our skills, I'm certain that I, and many women, would surpass you. Did you learn nothing from Dorcas?

You do sound like a very intelligent lady and i do not doubt that, i do not base things on what women can't do but what on they should do! there's a difference, women get pregnant, me﻿ i cannot get pregnant, therefore women stay at home and look after kids, cook and clean, while i go to work and work my ass off for my family, and it depends what you mean by skills? i can tell you there will be things that your better at, and there will be things that im better at.

Just because we can, doesn't mean we should. Will I be a stay-at-home mom for a bit, while my kids are little, should I have any? Probably. But that is my choice. I do not HAVE to do that. I could continue to work and take care of my family. Women are capable of doing both at the same time, and that is what this﻿ song is about. (As a side note, my father is the one who cleaned and took care of house, my mother cooked, and both looked after me. That's a true partnership.)

Actually, that was quote that a man said. Kina Rage stated that women are not allowed to﻿ do certain things because it is disrespectful to man's pride. That is not a delusion I have. Also, have you just completely blanked out on all the world records and history made by women. Go pick up a history book. And please try to form more coherent responses.

I've read your other comments in this thread, and your barely literate arguments, if you can even call them that, are laughable. The music video is for entertainment, obviously. What we are discussing here is the validity of the lyrics and women's equality. Clearly you don't understand that, though. Or maybe you do, and just lack any﻿ intelligence. I can't decide.

Also, fun fact for you. There are 17 female presidents and prime ministers in the world currently. Some are at the heads of some of the wealthiest and most productive countries in the world. And what are you doing with your life? Yep. Sounds like nothing remarkable. I applaud you on your﻿ effort to provide for your family, but I cannot respect someone who does not respect women.

Uh, yeah, it kind of does.﻿ They wouldn't even be a candidate for that kind of power if they were not qualified. Denmark's prime minister is a woman. Go do some research. Not only does Denmark boast the healthiest and happiest people in the world, they are design capitol, and are doing very well in inovation.

Well. Actually DK is going in the wrong direction if we talk about health. I'm from Denmark. More and more ppl is getting fat, as to lack of exercise. The Prime Minister, Helle Thorning... oh well.. don't even know where to begin, even though I supported her at first, she is not doing a great job. But enough said. DK is a great place to live in, if you want bad﻿ weather, a free health insurance, free education, and a minimum of crime, such as murder and stuff.. But that ain't all that matters :)

Yeah, like I said, laughable. Women are already a part of all those things. Clearly, you live in a box. There are 17 female presidents and prime ministers. I personally have female friends who are police officers and lawyers, and one family member who is﻿ a judge. Not to mention the highest court in the US has 3 female justices. Both sexes make and enforce law. What you say makes no sense. I don't have to wish for anything, it's already happening.

Ms. Wright, I totally disagree at how you described the﻿ Bible. If you have time and you are willing to listen, I would like to show you why the Bible does not promote prejudice against women and other sexes. There are a lot of Bible accounts that disprove your argument. I know Kina Rage's argument is not valid, so please do not think that I agree with that man.

1. Did God create us inferior to men? The answer is no. If you have a Bible (it﻿ doesn't matter if we have different translation), you can see in Genesis 1:27 that when God proceeded to create man in his image, male and female he created them. Thus, from the very start, both male and female were able to reflect God's qualities.

Very true, Dorcas. So few people, or I should say men rather, actually think logically about ideas represented in the Bible.﻿ In my experience, they're citing it as validation for their misogynistic, sexist, or other hateful/misguided view. That's where my comments were based. Not on the true text, but on the interpretation I have generally encountered. Like with Kina Rage. It's nice to converse with someone interpreting it for what it is.

Some argue that Genesis 2:18 proves otherwise when it said that God created Eve as a helper, or a complement, to Adam. They misunderstood it completely. The Hebrew word used for "complement' can also rendered as "counterpart" or a "help corresponding to" man. They're like a surgeon and an anesthetist during a surgery. Though the surgeon is﻿ the one performing the acutal operation, we don't say that the anesthetist is not important or inferior. (to be continued)

Thank you, Dorcas! Competing with each other does prove fruitless and destructive. We are equal counterparts, I agree wholeheartedly. Each sex brings something different﻿ to the table, complementing each other. That does not equate with the view that women are inferior or are only good at homemaking, like others try to insist. It means we differ, but are capable of the same potential. I am happy that you decided to share your thoughts.

Hello everyone! :)
I'm a rapper from North Carolina
I'm 20 years old and I've been writing and recording for about two years
I work extremely hard on my lyrics and flow, but it’s very hard to get views
and nothing gets me more hyped than making music. It’s my passion!
It would make my day if one of you could come through and listen?
Maybe you'll like it maybe not, but at least a view is what I'm hoping for..
Could you please help me along the road with﻿ a Big THUMBS UP?
Thank you all!!

Hello everyone! :)
I'm a rapper from North Carolina
I'm﻿ 20 years old and I've been writing and recording for about two years
I work extremely hard on my lyrics and flow, but it’s very hard to get views
and nothing gets me more hyped than making music. It’s my passion!
It would make my day if one of you could come through and listen?
Maybe you'll like it maybe not, but at least a view is what I'm hoping for..
Could you please help me along the road with a Big THUMBS UP?
Thank you all!!

Hello Everyone! I would really appreciate it if you could take some time to view my videos. My videos are dedicated to doing some poetry but my main focus is on sharing advice with others. Can you please thumbs this up if this got your attention? It would mean so much to me! I'm not looking to get popular on YouTube. I just want to be able to share my positive words with as many﻿ people as I can.

Men rule the world. Hence poverty, disease, death, wars, suffering, etc. If women ruled the world, babies, kids, children, young people and women would be taken care of. Women have a special quality that﻿ we would avoid war at all costs. We stand for peace. We would stop drone attacks, attacks on women and children. Only men could behave so vile against women and children. NO WOMEN DONT RUN OR RULE THE WORLD.

I think what you are trying to imply is that any criticism directed at any given female is by default sexist. My criticism was not by product of the gender, as I could have called the subject just about anything else, they﻿ all would have been relevant.

No, I am not.﻿ What I am saying is everything you have said on this video has been rooted in sexism against women. You didn't choose to call the subject anything else. You called her a 'twat.' Anytime anyone calls someone a 'twat' they are being derogatory to women. Even if you called a man that, you're telling him he is weak, lame, whatever and you're equating that with a woman. Which is sexist and highly derogatory. You might have a leg to stand on if you'd called her a 'dick', but you didn't.

But it isn't. It wouldn't be offensive to say "men rule the world", because they do. The numbers of male political leaders, CEO's, and religious figure heads are so overwhelmingly larger than females. Men have more rights, men have more privilege, there is not a whole﻿ lot men don't have. In third world countries, women are hardly more than children bearers. Beyoncé knows this and that's why this was filmed in Africa. It's about women empowerment, it's not meant to be taken literal.

Hello everyone! :)
I'm a rapper from North Carolina
I'm 20 years old and I've been writing and recording for about two years
I work extremely hard on my lyrics and flow, but it’s very hard to get views
and nothing gets me more hyped than making﻿ music. It’s my passion!
It would make my day if one of you could come through and listen?
Maybe you'll like it maybe not, but at least a view is what I'm hoping for..
Could you please help me along the road with a Big THUMBS UP?
Thank you all!!

You know what?... I think you're threatened﻿ by women and the influence and power that they can and do have. You obviously have no respect for the females of our race, so I suggest you take your segregationist, misogynist attitude somewhere else because not one person here has the tolerance for your tactlessness. Thank you and goodbye.

Retreat? Ha ha, I am not going anywhere. What could women possibly do that will be beyond your capacity? Oh well I don't know, maybe things like reproduce, you﻿ fool. And I'll bet my bottom dollar you're not the Prime Minister of Australia, or the German Chancelor, or the President of Brazil, or the Chief Executive of the IMF, or the USA's First Lady, or the Queen. If you are so repulsed by women with power and influnce, then go somewhere else, because you're wasting your breath here buddy.

For goodness sake, that isn't the point - the point was that a person does not have to be male to be a leader, or inspirational,﻿ or empowering. If you're going to nitpick, then nitpick-out something arguable.

ahh sigh at the idiocy of some women. what's ur educational background retard.saying that i couldn't reproduce being a man is tantamount to saying a woman couldn't create life into a dumb cell of the female, that a woman could give life.This how dumb you are that you have nothing to respond to the fact i told you, u retreat what is fallacious.We're not talking about sexual functions. here is a perspective for u, a man finds it degrading to think of having﻿ any quality of females let alone have it

why are women delusional....? i keep asking this question, despite of reality and facts, they keep clinging to wishful thinking, obviously in psychology that's called protection of the emotions/ego, but i think it has something to do with rational, it isn't operational at an optimum level in women.﻿

spend your time in something more useful than thinking about beating me, you might feel better after that and maybe youll release your anger, frustration or whatever it is that makes you want to beat somebody that you dont even know... bye ﻿

No, it is men who should be thanking women. Without us there would be no world to speak of. Your little spunk isn't responsible for carry a child 9 months to term, giving birth to it, and then raising it- that would be the woman. That's okay, though. Men fear what they cannot control and they lash﻿ out at it in response. The beautiful occurrence that is a woman has always sparked this need to control in men. If we were weak, they're be no need to try and keep us down.

no, it women who should be thanking men. Without us there would be no wold. Oh yeah? How about working to raise a child to obtain a successful future. Men are capable of controlling anything they set their eyes on. what are you talking about? xD Nice way of represting the women as whores. you just said "The beautiful occurrence that is a woman has always sparked﻿ this need to control in men". Are you trying to say that women control men cuz it's really pathetic. men always stand up for themselves

Um, no. There would be no world without either of us. We are equals. Your arguments make absolutely no sense. Why are you talking about whores? And you're clearly not capable of grasping coherent thought since you don't understand any point I have made. How is﻿ that quote saying women control men? It's not in any way saying that. Even if it did, it wouldn't be pathetic, for the record. Women stand up for themselves, we don't have anything to thank men for. Both sexes created this world.

Here are a few facts: Males have an XY females have XX. This is decided at conception. Second when a baby is born it's genitalia has already been formed, aka testes and penis for boys, eggs in the ovaries along with the vagina for girls. I'm not a misogynist, I have lesbian parents, but being ignorant to science and using it incorrectly is unacceptable. P.S. It's people like you that fuel the reason misogyny﻿ exists.

Fun fact: THAT'S NOT TRUE.
Everybody actually starts as female, the X Chromosome, which is more common than a Y chromosome (y = male). While they are still being developed in the womb, that chromosome will be determined. But all embryos start as an X chromosome. Basic genetics! :)
Also, that's why﻿ men have nipples. c;

And there wouldn't be no females if it weren't for males.
See? It's sort of a paradox, a forever-going circle. Can't we all agree that both males and females supplement each﻿ other and are of crucial importance for reproduction?

Your spelling is ridicilous you just said " Theres clearly now way I can embarrass myself". If you wanna correct someone's spelling you should correct your spelling first you little fool. btw your assumptions are﻿ entertaining when you try to make someone look like a fool, you make a fool out for yourself instead. good job.

Hello everyone! :)
I'm a rapper from North Carolina
I'm 20 years old and I've been writing and recording for about two years
I work extremely hard on my lyrics and flow, but it’s very hard to get views
and nothing gets me more hyped than making music. It’s my passion!
It would make my day if one of you could come through and listen?
Maybe you'll like it maybe not, but at least a view is what I'm hoping for..
Could you please help me along the road with a Big THUMBS UP?
Thank you﻿ all!!

I appreciate that the crowd on here do not represent 'true' feminism, however they are without doubt aspiring feminazis. Unfortunatley they believe that listening to one astoundingly dreadful 'song' by Beyonce (and liking it), gives them the right to consider themselves﻿ fully fledged intellectuals......

That's the thing I find with a lot of younger people that get into feminism. They've just discovered it and they're just too eager to get into arguments. They want﻿ to sound intelligent and progressive, radical, but they come off as.. yeah. You know.
The song is good for a certain type of dancing, I find.

There are only two types of women in America today. A whore or a bitch. A whore wants to fuck all the time, and please their man. A bitch only uses sex as a tool, and becomes a prude, especially once the honeymoon is over. Attention all men, there is a food out there that makes women lose﻿ 90%﻿ of their sex drive after they eat it. This food is called wedding cake..Better get the blow jobs while you can guys. After marriage, forget it.

A womans job is staying home﻿ and doing the cooking and cleaning AND giving a blowjob. Its all about multi-tasking like that. Call me old-fashioned, But the man is the the bread winner and women must wait at home until he finishes work. I think women lost that "nurturing" instinct,most women anyway. Women are greedy. They want it all, your money and your soul.

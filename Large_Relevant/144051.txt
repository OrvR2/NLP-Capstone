AFL-CIO chief vows ‘full-fledged campaign’ for immigration overhaulBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Tue, Jan 29, 2013Tweet0
AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka (Carolyn Kaster/AP)Organized labor is “entirely behind” comprehensive immigration reform and will mount a “full-fledged” campaign to help drive it through Congress, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told Yahoo News on Tuesday.
Trumka, whose federation comprises 57 unions representing some 12 million people, called the planned overhaul “one of our top priorities right now.” He spoke by telephone from Las Vegas, Nev., where he was to attend President Barack Obama’s speech on immigration reform.
“We think everybody ought to have the right to work hard and to progress to citizenship,” Trumka said.
White House officials cite robust support from organized labor—which at times in recent history has opposed giving the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants on U.S. soil a path to citizenship—as a key factor in their optimism about getting a comprehensive bill through Congress. They also point to the expansion of support among Christians, notably evangelicals. And they joke that the difficulty of managing a broad coalition is the kind of problem they like having.
Unions “did have at one point some differences” on the issue, but “the entire labor movement is entirely behind this now,” Trumka said. “We’ll be at the table the whole time this thing is being developed to make sure it meets the needs of workers.” Once it’s drafted, he continued, “we’ll be pushing this thing [with a] full-fledged campaign” aimed at both public opinion and wary lawmakers.

Remarkable photo shows fire blasting from Omaha manholesBy Mike Krumboltz | The Sideshow – Tue, Jan 29, 2013Tweet0
Flames burst from manholes in Omaha. (djtacoman/Reddit)
An Omaha resident took a remarkable photograph of fireballs erupting from manhole covers on Sunday night. The photo was posted to social network Reddit, where it quickly went viral.
What looks like a photo from the set of our favorite imaginary Stallone movie ("Fight Fire With Fists") is actually a real case of electrical fires gone wild. The below-ground inferno caused the flames to push the manhole covers sky-high. Parts of downtown Omaha plunged into darkness. Omaha.com reports that several thousand customers were initially without power, but that Omaha Public Power District worked to get that number down into the hundreds by Monday.

OPPD Vice President Tim Burke told FOX42 that the fire may have been caused by the combination of dry, salty air and the city's recent snowfall. "My guess is that it’s been dry, unusually dry, and with the moisture we’ve had, we’ve probably had some moisture get into cable or tape."

Obama announces new aid for Syrian rebelsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Tue, Jan 29, 2013Tweet0

Under fire for not doing more to help Syria’s rebels, President Barack Obama announced on Tuesday that he's sending opponents of strongman Bashar al-Assad another $155 million in humanitarian aid and defended his handling of the bloody conflict. Obama said the aid sends a message to the world.
“The relief we send doesn’t say ‘Made in America,’ but make no mistake—our aid reflects the commitment of the American people,” he said in a video posted on the White House website. The message includes Arabic subtitles.
Obama, who faces chiefly Republican criticism for not offering the rebels American weapons or taking other steps to beat back Assad’s armed forces, said the money would help Syrians under fire and those who have fled to neighboring countries.
“I want to speak directly to the people of Syria,” he said in the video. “This new aid will mean more warm clothing for children and medicine for the elderly; flour and wheat for your families and blankets, boots and stoves for those huddled in damaged buildings.
“It will mean health care for victims of sexual violence and field hospitals for the wounded,” he continued. “Even as we work to end the violence against you, this aid will help address some of the immediate needs you face each day."
The new aid will bring total U.S. assistance to Syrian rebels to $365 million.

Family of 14 gives up everything to live in RVBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! NewsSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Tue, Jan 29, 2013Tweet0
The Kellogg family in 2012. (Cody, 3 months, not pictured.)
“Every single day is a weekend."
That's how Susie Kellogg, mother of 12, describes family life these days, after she and her husband, Dan, decided to sell their Glenwood Springs, Colorado home last fall, fill up an RV with their children—all of them—and travel the country in search of adventure. Permanently.
All but one of the Kellogg children—aged 3 months to 19 years, each with names ending in a "y"—are home-, er, RV-schooled in the morning. In the afternoon, they explore: kayaking, hiking, camping—anything they want.
“This is what freedom is,” Dan Kellogg told the "Today" show. “You go after it.”
“I want them to live life in the moment and not be living for tomorrow or ‘After my kids are grown’ or ‘Thank God it’s Friday,’” Susie added.
The eldest child—Kerry, who graduated from high school last spring—gave up a chance to go to college, opting to join the family on the road and work on graphic design.
“[At first] I thought that going in an RV wasn’t normal and was weird,” she told the "Today" show. But "we can do anything we want now. Anything. And nothing is holding us back.”
“I am so ready for this,” Kerry told Denver's Fox 31. “I am over Glenwood. I just want to enjoy new adventures and see new places.”
The Kelloggs have a website (KelloggShow.com), Twitter feed, Facebook page and YouTube channel to document their travels and promote their unusual way of life. They even penned a parenting guide—"Raising a Badass Family"—that Dan calls "a ramped-up, modern version of that which Dr. Spock and Dr. T. Berry Brazelton pioneered in both the 1940s and 1990s."

Obama: I’ll introduce my own immigration bill if Congress doesn’t moveBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Tue, Jan 29, 2013Tweet0

President Barack Obama unveiled his vision for immigration reform in a speech on Tuesday afternoon in Las Vegas, Nev., telling Congress that he will send them his own bill and call for a vote if they don't move fast.
"If Congress is unable to move forward in a timely fashion, I will send up a bill based on my proposal and insist that they vote on it right away," Obama said to applause from students at Del Sol High School.
"It looks like there's a genuine desire to get this done soon, and that's very encouraging," Obama said, mentioning a blueprint put forward by a bipartisan group of eight senators on Monday. "But this time action must follow."
Obama's speech was the latest move in a chess match between the White House and some Republicans in Congress to craft an outline for reform that can both be enacted into law while meeting the expectataions of the growing population of Hispanic voters who now overwhelmingly favor Democrats.
Some Republicans want to support immigration reform in part to combat the party's demographic challenges, but the more involved the president is with the bill, the politically riskier it becomes to support it.
In his speech, Obama laid out "markers" for reform, saying any comprehensive immigration bill must give most of the nation's 11 million illegal immigrants a chance to earn their citizenship gradually if they pay a fine, learn English and pass a background check. Immigrants would also have to get to "the back of the line," which means people who have already applied for green cards would have their applications processed first.
The president's bill would also include an employment verification system, more border security and a revamping of the legal immigration system to provide more visas for top graduates of U.S. universities and to reduce lengthy wait times for visas for relatives of U.S. citizens.
The president mentioned the blueprint for reform laid out by senators including rising Republican star Marco Rubio of Florida and John McCain of Arizona, Obama's 2008 GOP presidential rival.
The principles of that outline "are very much in line with the principles I’ve proposed and campaigned on for the last few years," Obama said.

Tuesday in politics: Obama talks immigration in Vegas, and moreBy Joel Roberts, Yahoo! NewsJoel Roberts, Yahoo! NewsPostsBy Joel Roberts, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Tue, Jan 29, 2013Tweet0
Immigration remains at the top of the Washington agenda Tuesday, as President Obama travels to Las Vegas to rally public support for his proposals for reforming the nation's immigration system.
The president will deliver remarks in a campaign-style event this afternoon at Del Sol High School.
White House officials said Obama would largely endorse an immigration blueprint announced Monday by a bipartisan group of senators, though the president's plan was expected to be more progressive and include a faster pathway to citizenship for millions of people already in the U.S. illegally.
Also Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee meets to consider Obama's nomination of John Kerry to be secretary of state. Kerry is expected to win overwhelming approval from the panel, which he currently chairs.
Meanwhile, the outgoing secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, hosts a "Global Townterview," in which she will take questions from young people around the world via satellite, Twitter, Facebook,

‘No Numbers Here’: Math Museum Founder Glen WhitneyBy Tanya Rivero, Nick Poppy, Mary-Rose Abraham and Christina LopezPostsBy Tanya Rivero, Nick Poppy, Mary-Rose Abraham and Christina Lopez | Newsmakers – Mon, Jan 28, 2013Tweet0
We live in a world surrounded by numbers. Whether we’re 
balancing our checkbooks, reading recipes or calculating what the best 
deals at the supermarket are, chances are you’re thinking, writing and 
communicating in numbers. There’s now a museum in New York City that is centered on math but has very few numbers. Glen Whitney is the executive director of the National Museum of Math in Manhattan and says there’s a lot more to math. “Math
 touches on so many things in the world around us there’s a connection 
between mathematics and music, connection with engineering, between 
mathematics and business, between mathematics and art,” said Whitney. 
“And we want to show all those parts of mathematics here.” A math
 enthusiast since the age of 14, Whitney said his love for numbers 
continued to grow when he realized math was more about what new things 
he could discover that no one had ever seen before. After a 
career as a math scholar and then a professor at the University of 
Michigan,

Florida women frighten off intruder by chanting ‘Jesus’By Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! NewsReporterPostsRSSBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! News | The Sideshow – Mon, Jan 28, 2013Tweet0
Suspect Derick Lee, after being arrested by police (Lake City Police Department)If you ask the 15 women inside Jacquie Hagler’s house what happened, they’ll tell you it’s simple: Jesus scared a would-be thief out of the Florida woman’s home.
At first, those gathered at Hagler’s house for a jewelry party thought the intruder was part of an elaborate gag, using a “water gun” to tease the Florida women.
"It's only a water gun," one attendee reportedly said, while brushing away the firearm allegedly brandished by Derick Lee, who allegedly entered the home wearing a ski cap and bandana across his face.
Witnesses say Lee then held the gun to the woman’s head and announced, "I'm not joking, I'm going to shoot someone, give me your money." He even showed the women some of the bullets loaded into his gun before they could be convinced the robbery attempt was real.
What Lee didn’t know was that, spiritually speaking, he was outgunned by the jewelry party attendees.
"When I realized what was going on, I stood up and said, 'In the name of Jesus, get out of my house now,'”

105-year-old woman renews driver’s licenseBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! NewsReporterPostsRSSBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! News | The Sideshow – Mon, Jan 28, 2013Tweet0
105-year-old Edythe Kirchmaier recently renewed her California drivers license (Facebook)There apparently isn’t much that can slow down Edythe Kirchmaier. The 105-year-old California resident made headlines on Monday when she passed her driving test – continuing 86 years without a blemish on her driving record and maintaining her status as the state's oldest living driver.
"I just couldn't imagine myself without a car," Kirchmaier told FoxNews.com. "It just didn't feel very good."
And that’s far from the only bit of notoriety to crop up recently in Kirchmaier’s life. Facebook has declared her its most senior user, she's the University of Chicago's oldest living former student, last week she appeared on The Ellen Degeneres Show to celebrate her birthday and she has been a volunteer with the Direct Relief International (DRI) organization for 40 years.
To honor Kirchmaier, who says she wants to use her age milestone to help inspire volunteer efforts around the world, DRI set up a Facebook app where her fans can light a virtual candle to help celebrate her 105th birthday. The

Funeral procession swings by Burger King to honor deceasedBy Mike Krumboltz | The Sideshow – Mon, Jan 28, 2013Tweet0

David S. Kime Jr. was many things. World War II veteran. Purple Heart recipient. Father. Grandfather. Husband. And, it should be noted, Burger King enthusiast.
The 88-year-old Kime died Jan. 20, and during his funeral procession a few days later, members of Kime's family took a detour to the Burger King drive-through.
Linda Phiel, one of Kime's three daughters, said her dad loved fast food and ate it daily. "He always lived by his own rules," she said. "His version of eating healthy was the lettuce on the Whopper Jr."
The York (Pa.) Daily Record spoke with Phiel, who explained that when her mother was alive, she tried to keep his eating habits in check. "When she died, for a while, he would eat with us," she said. "But he considered us health freaks because we ate things that were green, like broccoli."
After a while, Phiel stopped trying to talk her dad into eating more veggies. "When you're 88 years old, I guess you've earned the right to do what you want to do," she said.

Ladies Against Senator Sleaze-BobMichelle Malkin - 22 hrs agoConservatives are always told they don't do enough to reach across the aisle. We're divisive, obstructionist and hostile to bipartisanship. So in the spirit of unity and comity, I'm announcing the formation of a new social justice group: Ladies Against Senator Sleaze-Bob.

So does his pal PSY, the Korean rapper whose "Gangnam Style" music video has racked up more than a billion views worldwide. Both men have raked in big bucks from Western fans while trashing the very freedoms and cultures that made them superstars.

Instead of standing alone, bearing full responsibility for the imperial actions he is about to take, President Obama will surround himself with an audience of kids who wrote to him after the Newtown, Conn., school massacre. This is the most cynical in Beltway theatrical staging — a feckless attempt to invoke "For the Children" immunity by hiding behind them.

Drunk, besotted, bombed. But while politicians pay lip service to cutting government waste, fraud and abuse, they're doing very little in practice to stop the EBT party excesses.

It's not about improving dockworkers' living standards. The looming, long-planned East and Gulf Coast port strikes are about protecting Big Labor's archaic work practices and corrupt waterfront rackets.

Public death threats and incitements to violence must be taken seriously. The incendiary witch hunt against law-abiding, peaceful gun owners is neither noble nor effective. It's just plain insane.

Buried in the trillion-dollar stimulus law of 2009 was an electronic medical records "incentive" program. Like most of President Obama's health care rules, this top-down electronic record-sharing scheme is a big fat bust.

He Who Heals advocated "a more civil and honest public discourse" in the wake of the January 2011 Tucson massacre.

Rosen. More »Real Moms of the GOP vs. White House SOPDon't Do Business with Progressive AppeasersMichelle Malkin - Wed, Apr 11, 2012Let's stipulate: Activists on the left are free to exercise their rights of speech and assembly to boycott businesses whose politics they oppose. Conversely, activists on the right are free to exercise the power of their pocketbooks and refrain from supporting businesses that shun their values. More »Don't Do Business with Progressive AppeasersMarion Barry and the Left's Hatred of Asian EntrepreneursMichelle Malkin - Fri, Apr 6, 2012Marion Barry's mouth set him up. The disgraced former mayor of Washington, D.C., who was caught on tape in a 1987 crack cocaine sting, made an even bigger disgrace of himself and his city on Tuesday. Celebrating a Democratic primary victory, the city councilman attacked small businesses owned by "Asians" in his district. Then the race-baiting clown doubled down. More »Marion Barry and the Left's Hatred of Asian EntrepreneursThe Democrats' Election Forgery Racket Michelle Malkin - Wed, Apr 4, 2012A few weeks ago, Obama senior adviser and seasoned Chicago operative David Axelrod joked on MSNBC about election corruption. Asked whether "vote early and often" scams had come to an end in his shady hometown, Axelrod snarked: "Well, certainly on the air." Yuk, yuk, yuk. More »The Democrats' Election Forgery Racket Eco-Scams Are as Easy as A123Michelle Malkin - Fri, Mar 30, 2012While President Obama was busy lambasting Big Oil tax breaks on Thursday, yet another one of his environmental welfare recipients (the very kind he wants to redistribute oil subsidies to) was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. Who needs to win the Mega Millions lottery? Start a pie-in-the-sky eco-boondoggle, and a half-billion-dollar jackpot ripe for squandering is all yours! More »Eco-Scams Are as Easy as A123The War on WisconsinMichelle Malkin - Wed, Mar 28, 2012Now is the time for all good tea partiers to come to the aid of Wisconsin. Fiscally conservative leaders in the Badger State are under coordinated siege from Big Labor, the White House, the liberal media and the judiciary. The yearlong campaign of union thuggery, family harassment and intimidation of Republican donors and businesses is about to escalate even further. This is the price the Right pays for doing the right thing. More »The War on WisconsinThe Obamacare HydraMichelle Malkin - Fri, Mar 23, 2012The Hydra was a mythical swamp beast whose multiple heads grew back after being severed. Obamacare is a real Washington monster whose countless hidden bureaucracies keep sprouting forth even after they're rooted out. As soon as combatants lop off one of the law's unconstitutional agencies, another takes its place. More »The Obamacare HydraObama's Algae RacketMichelle Malkin - Wed, Mar 21, 2012Pond scum stinks. And so do the Obama administration's enormous, taxpayer-funded "investments" in politically connected biofuel companies. While the president embarks on a green rehabilitation tour this week to quell growing public outrage about big green boondoggles, the White House continues to cultivate a cozy algae racket. More »Obama's Algae RacketThe Myth of Middle-Class Uncle JoeMichelle Malkin - Fri, Mar 16, 2012This has got to be the bazooka of all Joe Biden blowhardisms. The nation's vice campaigner in chief went on the attack against Republicans this week, clad in full populist armor. "These guys don't have a sense of the average folks out there," said The Everyman. "They don't know what it means to be middle class." But who was his audience? More »The Myth of Middle-Class Uncle JoeWhat's the Matter with Soledad O'Brien?Michelle Malkin - Wed, Mar 14, 2012CNN's Soledad O'Brien isn't used to criticism. In the world of media elites, she's a beloved figure and an award-winning news anchor. But last week, she revealed her true, decidedly non-neutral colors. And she's not happy about the hoi polloi questioning her hallowed journalistic objectivity. More »What's the Matter with Soledad O'Brien?Colorado's Own Green Loan SinkholeMichelle Malkin - Fri, Mar 9, 2012There's no escaping Solyndra Syndrome. Here in my home state of Colorado, citizen journalists have uncovered our own gaping government green loan sinkhole. The stench of Chicago-on-the-Potomac is fouling the fresh Rocky Mountain air. More »Colorado's Own Green Loan SinkholeThe War on Conservative WomenMichelle Malkin - Wed, Mar 7, 2012I'm sorry Rush Limbaugh called 30-year-old Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke a "slut." She's really just another professional femme-a-gogue helping to manufacture a false narrative about the GOP "war on women." I'm sorry the civility police now have an opening to demonize the entire right based on one radio comment — because it's the progressive left in this country that has viciously and systematically slimed female conservatives for their beliefs. More »The War on Conservative WomenObama's Campaign Bully Brigade Rides AgainMichelle Malkin - Fri, Mar 2, 2012They're baaaaaaack. Barack Obama's election-year goon squad kicked into high gear this week by kicking the president's fiercest opponents in the teeth and targeting their pocketbooks. Returning to bully business as usual, the Obama campaign launched a brazen salvo against two prominent conservative critics and their legions of private citizen donors. More »Obama's Campaign Bully Brigade Rides AgainThe Autoworkers Obama Left BehindMichelle Malkin - Wed, Feb 29, 2012The White House fairy tale about the Happily Ever After Auto Bailout is missing a crucial, bloody page. While President Obama bragged about "standing by American workers" at a rowdy United Auto Workers meeting Tuesday, he failed to acknowledge how the Chicago-style deal threw tens of thousands of nonunion autoworkers under the bus. More »The Autoworkers Obama Left BehindTaxing Medical Progress to DeathMichelle Malkin - Mon, Feb 27, 2012Two years ago this month, as public debate over Obamacare raged, former President Bill Clinton rushed to the hospital because of a heart condition. He immediately underwent a procedure to place two stents in one of his coronary arteries. It was a timely reminder about the dangers of stifling private-sector medical innovation. No one listened. More »Taxing Medical Progress to DeathA Tea Party Senate TakeoverMichelle Malkin - Wed, Feb 15, 2012The tea party isn't dead. It's just looking down ballot. While fiscal conservatives remain split over the GOP presidential candidates, grassroots activists are coalescing around a stellar slate of limited-government candidates looking to reinforce and reenergize the right in Washington. More »A Tea Party Senate TakeoverTo Stop the Multiplication of the UnfitMichelle Malkin - Fri, Feb 10, 2012If you aren't creeped out by the No Birth Control Left Behind rhetoric of the White House and Planned Parenthood, you aren't listening closely enough. The anesthetic of progressive benevolence always dulls the senses. Wake up. More »To Stop the Multiplication of the UnfitSuper PAC-Men: Obama Bundlers Gone Wild!Michelle Malkin - Wed, Feb 8, 2012The White House didn't blow a dog whistle for deep-pocketed liberal donors on Monday. No, the administration whipped out a supersized vuvuzela. Blaring message: Let loose the campaign finance-bundling hounds of super PAC war! More »Super PAC-Men: Obama Bundlers Gone Wild!Jim Moran, Racist PigMichelle Malkin - Fri, Feb 3, 2012Congressman Jim Moran is an old white Democrat from Virginia who thinks he can judge whether we minority conservatives are acting sufficiently non-white enough. Moran's an inveterate bully, a brawler, a crook and a bigot. And not one of his civility-preaching liberal colleagues has the courage to call him out. More »Jim Moran, Racist PigFirst, They Came for the CatholicsMichelle Malkin - Wed, Feb 1, 2012President Obama and his radical feminist enforcers have had it in for Catholic medical providers from the get-go. It's about time all people of faith fought back against this unprecedented encroachment on religious liberty. First, they came for the Catholics. Who's next? More »First, They Came for the CatholicsMr. and Mrs. Cranky PantsMichelle Malkin - Fri, Jan 27, 2012So, it turns out that the cool cat billed as "No Drama Obama" by his sycophants is actually quite the drama queen. While the White House publicly pretends to ignore conservative detractors of his administration, Chief Touchy-Touchy seems to be personally consumed by our critiques. Yes, mine included. More »Mr. and Mrs. Cranky PantsObama's Green Robber BaronsMichelle Malkin - Wed, Jan 25, 2012Had enough of fat cat Barack Obama, his jet-setting wife and his multi-millionaire Chicago consigliere/real-estate mogul Valerie Jarrett attacking the "rich"? Well, brace yourselves. You'll be hearing much more from the White House about the "wealthy few" who aren't paying their "fair share" as Obama's re-election campaign doubles down on class-war demagoguery. More »Obama's Green Robber BaronsThe Land of Obama Make-BelieveMichelle Malkin - Fri, Jan 20, 2012Where did President Obama go after killing off thousands of Keystone XL pipeline construction and manufacturing jobs? Why, Disney World, of course. Sabotaging work is hard work for Goofy and his pals.  More »The Land of Obama Make-BelieveThe Bank of (Democratic Party) AmericaMichelle Malkin - Wed, Jan 18, 2012Well, isn't this rich? And I do mean rich. President Obama, man of the people, will deliver his presidential nomination acceptance speech at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, N.C. — so that Democratic Party fundraisers can reward big donors with skyboxes and other lavish perks.

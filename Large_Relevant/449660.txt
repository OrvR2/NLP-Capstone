Opinion - Susan Estrich
The $6 Billion ScamSusan Estrich - 22 hrs agoWhile all the figures aren't in and almost certainly never will be, the Center for Responsive Politics has estimated that roughly $6 billion was spent on the 2012 election, including $2 billion on the presidential contest and something on the order of $4 billion on congressional and state races. This gives us, I suppose, the best government money can buy — which is certainly not the best we could have. More »The $6 Billion ScamMarriage Without PregnancySusan Estrich - Wed, Jan 30, 2013The briefs opposing gay marriage in the two cases currently under consideration in the Supreme Court are strange to say the least. Unlike past battles, the briefs do not argue that homosexuality is immoral. Major step forward. Sex is fine. Marriage is the problem. More »Marriage Without PregnancyWomen in CombatSusan Estrich - Fri, Jan 25, 2013It was in 1981 that the United States Supreme Court, in a decision that I still have trouble explaining to my students when I teach it, held that it was constitutional for the Selective Service, acting under the authority of Congress and the president, to require all men — but not women — between the ages of 18 and 25 to register for a potential draft.  More »Women in CombatThe Second Time AroundSusan Estrich - Wed, Jan 23, 2013It is hard to remember how much better things are in America today than they were four years ago when Barack Obama took the oath of office for the first time. More »The Second Time AroundStill HopingSusan Estrich - Fri, Jan 18, 2013In the days before the re-inauguration of President Obama, there have been the usual curtain raisers, with the usual suspects screaming from their respective corners about the usual stuff. More »Still HopingThe Promise and the PontificatorsSusan Estrich - Wed, Jan 16, 2013My eyes filled with tears as I listened to the parents of the victims of the shooting in Newtown, Conn., speak out, many for the first time. They gathered to announce the founding of a nonprofit group, Sandy Hook Promise. Their purpose was to engage in the public dialogue about what they called "gun responsibility." They want something positive to come from their children's deaths. More »The Promise and the PontificatorsThe Other Side of the Gun DebateSusan Estrich - Fri, Jan 11, 2013As politicians in Washington debate whether new laws should be issued to tighten up on background checks, impose limits on assault weapons and regulate ammunition sales and the like — a debate likely to be dominated by politics — it is worth focusing on the other side of the gun question, the public health side. More »The Other Side of the Gun DebatePower and PowerlessnessSusan Estrich - Wed, Jan 9, 2013Years ago, when the candidate I was working for rejected my advice, I made the mistake of going back to the headquarters and telling my loyal staff (who together had formulated the rejected proposal) that our recommendation had been declined. I did my best, I told them, but I just couldn't make the sale. More »Power and PowerlessnessThe Truth About Bin LadenSusan Estrich - Fri, Jan 4, 2013At the very beginning of Kathryn Bigelow's "Zero Dark Thirty," the audience is told that the movie they are about to see is "based on firsthand accounts of actual events." Then we hear tapes, terrifying if familiar, of those final calls being made by those trapped on 9/11.  More »The Truth About Bin LadenNew Years and the New YouSusan Estrich - Wed, Jan 2, 2013From the time I was a teenager until I turned 40, I made the same New Year's resolution every year. Not to get healthy or exercise regularly (I still make those) but to lose weight, plain and simple. My mother had a thing about weight, but by the time you turn 40, it's a little late to be blaming your mother for everything. So at 40, I just did it. After having two children in three years, never losing the weight from the first before gaining even more with the second, I was, for want of a better term, fat. It wasn't a case of not being able to see my body clearly. I saw it  ... More »New Years and the New YouPolitics and Personal ResponsibilitySusan Estrich - Wed, Dec 19, 2012In the wake of the Newtown, Conn., tragedy, every politician who has me on their email list — and there are many, on both sides of the aisle — has been filling my inbox. All of the messages begin with the requisite expression of shock and horror, the business of sending out our hearts and prayers to those who mourn. Then the gun control advocates insist that now is the time for congressional action, and the opponents caution that no legislation is going to stop people (not guns) from killing.  More »Politics and Personal ResponsibilityDavid Geffen's GiftSusan Estrich - Fri, Dec 14, 2012I will never forget the day I went over to the loan office that used to be at Harvard's Holyoke Center and gave them my last student loan repayment check. I walked out actually feeling lighter. I was a tenured professor at Harvard at the time, but I remembered — and still do — the years when the only way I could afford to eat was to put the meal on my "bursar's card" and just pile more onto that loan. More »David Geffen's GiftChristmas in Santa MonicaSusan Estrich - Wed, Dec 12, 2012Christmas in my home city of Santa Monica is different this year. It used to be that there were elaborate displays depicting the birth of Jesus in the big public park by the ocean. I've always believed that Christmas is a major religious holiday, and the display reflected that. According to people who know more about such things than I do, the large dioramas told the story of Jesus' birth according to the Gospels of Luke and Matthew. More »Christmas in Santa MonicaThe Miracle of the Rule of LawSusan Estrich - Wed, Dec 5, 2012It's easy, as a law professor and practicing lawyer, to take the rule of law for granted and even to question its existence. In my classes, I teach students cases in which courts, on similar facts, reach conflicting results, notwithstanding the fundamental principle that the rule of law means like cases must be treated alike. What's the difference, I ask my students, knowing that sometimes, the answer is no more than who is sitting in the room.  More »The Miracle of the Rule of LawWho Is Susan Rice?Susan Estrich - Fri, Nov 30, 2012I have known Susan Rice for decades. We worked together in the '80s. I followed her career in the '90s. She served her country with intelligence and integrity during the Clinton administration and for the past four years as our country's representative to the United Nations. More »Who Is Susan Rice?Who's Depressed Now?Susan Estrich - Wed, Nov 28, 2012It seems hard to believe that the election was only three short weeks ago, and that even as the results were coming in proving Nate Silver (the much maligned New York Times blogger) right and the pillars of conservatism (Dick Morris, George Will and, of course, Karl Rove) completely wrong, Republicans thought they had it won and Mitt Romney had only one speech prepared. More »Who's Depressed Now?Half-Full GlassesSusan Estrich - Wed, Nov 21, 2012Like many people, I have a tendency to spend more time thinking about what's wrong than what's right, what's missing rather than what is there, what I don't have instead of what I do. More »Half-Full GlassesAn Officer and a GentlemanSusan Estrich - Fri, Nov 16, 2012Something very wrong has just gone down. It's played out so much like a soap opera, for those following the twists and turns of who sent whom a shirtless photo, but at its core, it is very simple. America has just lost the much-needed services of one of the most brilliant military leaders of our time because he had an affair with the woman who wrote his biography. More »An Officer and a GentlemanThe Mandate To Raise Taxes on the RichSusan Estrich - Wed, Nov 14, 2012Within days of winning the election, President Obama announced that his victory gave him a mandate to raise taxes on the "rich."  More »The Mandate To Raise Taxes on the RichTake TwoSusan Estrich - Fri, Nov 9, 2012Now that the election is over, and President Obama has returned to Washington to try to turn all the rhetoric about working together into something real, Republicans and talking heads (especially the conservative ones whose predictions seemed to be based entirely on wishful thinking and perhaps the desire for some last-minute fundraising) are obsessing about how Mitt Romney managed to lose this election.  More »Take TwoOne CountrySusan Estrich - Fri, Nov 2, 2012I'm sitting here in the bright sunshine in Pompeii. At any minute, the Earth could shake, and my city would look no better, and possibly worse, than New York. It might happen this week, this year, this decade or long after I'm gone. You just can't know. But this much we do know: If and when it occurs, California will need the help of people from the rest of this country to dig out. More »One CountryThe October SurpriseSusan Estrich - Wed, Oct 31, 2012Don't get me wrong. Like most Americans, politics was the last thing on my mind as I waited to hear from my daughter, who lost power and cell service Monday night, along with millions of other Americans, and was trying to figure out what to do and where to go with a roommate and two kittens. In a crisis, we're all Americans first, and if that shuts off this campaign for a few days, it's probably the only positive from this storm. More »The October SurpriseWaitress Moms and AbortionSusan Estrich - Fri, Oct 26, 2012As everyone tries to figure out an exceedingly close election, the focus on women — unmarried women in some stories, blue-collar women in others, unmarried blue-collar women maybe — intensifies. Could they play the decisive role? Especially if they live in Ohio.

More »World Series TimeEnough Mother's MilkSusan Estrich - Wed, Oct 10, 2012There was something ironic about the latest headlines detailing President Barack Obama's record fundraising success. His gigantic haul in September — some $181 million — was a big step up from the record pace set by both campaigns in August, when the president and his "affiliates" took in $114 million while Gov. Mitt Romney and his affiliate team took in $111 million.  More »Enough Mother's MilkPolls Don't VoteSusan Estrich - Wed, Oct 3, 2012That's what Vice President Walter Mondale used to say at every stop in the closing days of the campaign. "Polls don't vote. People vote."  More »Polls Don't VoteThe Femininity FactorSusan Estrich - Fri, Sep 28, 2012Are Republican women politicians more "feminine" than Democratic women politicians? More »The Femininity FactorAtonementSusan Estrich - Wed, Sep 26, 2012As I write this, Jews across the world are preparing for the holiest day of the year: Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. Yom Kippur is the day on which we seek forgiveness for the sins of the past year and ask God to inscribe us and those we love in the book of life. We light candles for those we have lost and say special prayers. It is and always has been a painful holiday for me, and not just because of the fast that begins at sundown. More »AtonementThe 47 PercentSusan Estrich - Wed, Sep 19, 2012If one thing should be clear by now, it is that nothing a president or presidential candidate says is private. Assume every microphone is hot, every fundraiser is public, every side comment will be reported.  More »The 47 PercentPeter Michael UlikhanovSusan Estrich - Fri, Sep 14, 2012It is a strange experience to go to your healer's funeral, and it is especially strange when he was only 58 and died from a disease that might well have been cured by Western medicine.  More »Peter Michael UlikhanovEleven Years LaterSusan Estrich - Wed, Sep 12, 2012I will never forget the phone ringing on that sunny September morning and my friend Annie telling me to turn on the television because the world was going to hell. My children, then 8 and 11, woke up a few minutes later to see me staring at the images of the planes hitting the towers.  More »Eleven Years LaterThat Old Clinton MagicSusan Estrich - Fri, Sep 7, 2012Back in 1988, we had what we thought was a great new idea. There was only one slot for a keynote speech at the Democratic convention on Monday night, but we had two great candidates for the job. One was the late Ann Richards, then the treasurer of the state of Texas and a candidate for governor, famous for her wit and wisdom (remember: George Bush was born "with a silver foot in his mouth"). The other was the governor of Arkansas, a young star of the party, a charismatic speaker, a southern moderate and a good friend. ... More »That Old Clinton Magic"Forward"Susan Estrich - Wed, Sep 5, 2012In backgrounding reporters in advance of the Democratic convention, organizers reportedly stressed that the tone in Charlotte would be much more optimistic than that in Tampa: that Democrats are looking "forward," focusing on the future, even as they trumpet President Obama's past accomplishments. More »"Forward"Paul Ryan's Speech BubbleSusan Estrich - Fri, Aug 31, 2012The commentators may be raving, but if you ask me, they're living in a bubble — along with the candidate. More »Paul Ryan's Speech BubbleLegitimate RapeSusan Estrich - Wed, Aug 22, 2012Rep. Todd Akin is staying in the Missouri Senate race, notwithstanding the calls of many fellow Republicans that he step aside after flaunting his ignorance about anatomy and his lack of empathy for the victims of rape so publicly over the weekend. More »Legitimate RapeVice Presidents?Susan Estrich - Fri, Aug 17, 2012The conventional wisdom, at least until about four years ago, was that vice presidential selections, even the very good and the very bad, don't end up mattering very much by November. Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle are perhaps the two best examples, the former with poll numbers through the roof (especially after the infamous "Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy" debate) and the latter, well, enough said. From the beginning, Quayle was viewed as a fair or poor choice by a majority of Americans. If it mattered, I might be Justice Estrich, instead of your local columnist.  More »Vice Presidents?Karl FlemingSusan Estrich - Wed, Aug 15, 2012If you read the obituaries of Karl Fleming, who died last weekend (and I hope you do), you will find a story worthy of the man who lived it. Born into dire poverty and raised in an orphanage because his mother, after the death of Karl's father and then of his stepfather, simply could not afford to raise him, he was — and this is the title of his wonderful memoir — a "Son of the Rough South."  More »Karl FlemingWhat Do Women Want?Susan Estrich - Fri, Aug 10, 2012President Obama was in Colorado on Wednesday trying to solidify his lead among women, appearing at rallies with Sandra Fluke, the Georgetown Law student who made headlines when Rush Limbaugh called her a "slut" (for which he later apologized, in some people's view because of advertiser pressure) after she testified in favor of insurance coverage of contraceptives.  More »What Do Women Want?Mother's MilkSusan Estrich - Wed, Aug 8, 2012News alert: Mitt Romney is raising a lot of money. A whole lot. So much that in the past three months, he's been out-raising the incumbent president, which is no easy feat. So much that the chattering class is beginning to wonder whether the president's team has been spending too much too early, as opposed to saving it for later.  More »Mother's MilkRomney Does It AgainSusan Estrich - Wed, Aug 1, 2012Last spring, when he was ever so carefully seeking the Republican nomination, Mitt Romney's scripted, straight-from-the-briefing-book style made him a favorite of the comedians on "Saturday Night Live." On the other hand, when he went off script — the Cadillacs and the NASCAR owners — it was even worse. That's when Democrats were giving each other high-fives and thinking about the new drapes in the White House.

He's spending the summer working for a major gaming company. I know (and try to think less about) what a dangerous place the world is. I understand that many people are concerned about the influence of violence in every form of media, including video games. But how could someone die just by playing a video game?

That's right: According to the great silent majority of students surveyed over the past three years by the Department of Education, the problem is not too much homework but too little; it's not assignments that demand too much, but those that are, quite literally, too easy. More »Trouble in the MiddleBack in the USASusan Estrich - Fri, Jul 6, 2012Some of my fondest memories of childhood are of the Fourth of July. In Swampscott, Mass., we used to have a parade of kids on bikes that went down Aspen Road and then around the corner to Forest Ave. and then up around Lexington Circle, our bikes decorated with red, white and blue crepe paper carefully slotted through the spokes of the wheels. Then, in the afternoon, we'd go down to Phillips Park for all the races, and even though I was never very fast and could never jump very far, there were usually ribbons for everyone. ...

More »The Race to the BottomPresident Obama's Great Bad WeekSusan Estrich - Wed, Jun 13, 2012President Barack Obama's campaign had a great and much-needed terrible week or so: bad economic news (that keeps on coming), questions about leaks of national security information (When you leak a target list that makes the president look tough, is that politically motivated? When you do it in June, when no one's paying attention, is that so politically stupid that they couldn't be that stupid?), not to mention being outraised by Mitt Romney and the RNC in a month when the president raised $60 million, and getting killed in Wisconsin, which is how it looked even if they tried to  ...

More »Caught in the MiddleHeading to the SupremesSusan Estrich - Wed, Jun 6, 2012One way or another, the issue of gay marriage seems squarely headed to the Supreme Court. Two federal appellate court decisions, one in Massachusetts and the other in California, have set the stage for challenges to federal and state laws limiting marriage to a union between a man and a woman. But the bigger news is that a confrontation in the court, which many civil libertarians and gay rights activists originally feared would come too soon, now seems to be proceeding at just the right pace.

The switches for the lights aren't switches but lighted panels. There is not an iron to be found. I am a pedestrian traveler. I have a $35 fruit cocktail on the roof. It's fine. The view is amazing.

For all the shock and chagrin about Rosen's comment (which was, of course, poorly put, but was an effort to address the question of whether the Romneys could understand the problems of "people like us," as pollsters usually ask it), it turns out that Mrs. Romney wasn't insulted at all. ...

I eased out a foot or two and saw what had just happened in front of my house. A bicyclist was down on the pavement, alive but not moving, flat on his back.

The killing of 16 Afghan men, women and children by an American soldier without provocation and without threat to his own life (or so it appears) was wrong. Completely wrong. It is an unspeakable tragedy for all those involved. It places the lives of other Americans in danger. I'm no fan of the myriad "abuse excuses" that once held sway in the American legal system. Those who know the difference between right and wrong and have the capacity to choose are responsible for choosing wrongly. End of story.

Usually, the departures are "friendly," even if they really aren't. You use your credentials — and the references — from that top firm to get a job with a slightly less top firm or with a client or affiliate. What you don't do is trash your old firm, which makes you a pariah.

More »Taking CareWho's in Charge?Susan Estrich - Wed, Feb 22, 2012The fight between Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum doesn't just raise questions about each man's strengths and weaknesses. It also raises, as fundamentally as any battle in recent decades, the question of who, ultimately, is in charge of picking the nominee. More »Who's in Charge?The Santorum SurgeSusan Estrich - Fri, Feb 17, 2012Could it really happen? More »The Santorum SurgeThat's What Friends Are ForSusan Estrich - Wed, Feb 15, 2012Here we go again: a tragedy in the music world, a tragedy waiting to happen that did. Disturbing headlines before and after leave us scratching our heads and asking why. On the days before her death, Whitney Houston was disheveled, dressed in clothes that didn't match, hair dripping with water or sweat, doing handstands by the pool, waving her arms erratically at a rehearsal, visiting doctors in Beverly Hills and even filling prescriptions at the Michael Jackson-made-famous Mickey Fine Pharmacy. And yes, she checked in to the hotel with a large retinue.  More »That's What Friends Are ForWhat Happened to Newt and Mitt?Susan Estrich - Fri, Feb 10, 2012Newt's easy. While all of us on the Democratic side were playing "root for Newt," Republicans were taking the proverbial second and third look — and getting scared by what they saw. Hello, Herman Cain.  More »What Happened to Newt and Mitt?Chasing EqualitySusan Estrich - Wed, Feb 8, 2012Tuesday's ruling by a panel of three judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit holding unconstitutional the California ballot initiative that aimed to take the right to marry away from same-sex couples is hardly the last word in the debate. The court's ruling, unlike that of the district court below, did not purport to decide whether states must, in the first instance, give marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but only that, once they do, they cannot take them away for no good reason. ... More »Chasing EqualityPrimary PurposesSusan Estrich - Fri, Feb 3, 2012If the goal of the primary process is simply to nominate a candidate, essentially to nominate the man or woman most likely to win in the end, then this primary season should be declared over. Clear the stage, and give it to Mitt Romney. Newt Gingrich's promise to go the next 46 notwithstanding, you couldn't find anyone in Vegas to give you ballpark odds on his winning. And forget about Ron Paul or Rick Santorum. They never had a chance.  More »Primary PurposesTen Reasons Why Newt Gingrich Shouldn't Drop OutSusan Estrich - Wed, Feb 1, 201210. It would be very boring. People would stop paying attention to presidential politics. Campaigns are unique learning experiences, as Professor Gingrich certainly knows.

That's what all the talking heads were saying about the president's State of the Union. And they didn't mean long.

More »Dear DemocratsAbout the DogSusan Estrich - Wed, Jan 18, 2012There is a famous story (it may be apocryphal, of course) about Richard Nixon and his dog. No, I don't mean the Checkers speech, the one where Nixon saved his integrity by invoking his little dog, Checkers, and his wife's cloth coat. This one came later, after he lost, during the famous Bel Air fire. The story is that as he was fleeing his house, Nixon left his dog. More »About the DogThe People Have SpokenSusan Estrich - Fri, Jan 13, 2012The people have spoken — all 126,185 of them. That's how many votes turned Mitt Romney into the Republican nominee, for all intents and purposes. In a country with more than 300 million people, less than a tenth of a half of a percent have picked one of the two men who could be the next president of the United States. More »The People Have SpokenEchoes of World War II in NormandySusan Estrich - Wed, Jan 11, 2012No one told me that January is the wrong time to visit Normandy (until afterwards, that is). Most of the places we went to visit were closed. It was cold and wet and rainy. It took more than three hours each way. But I haven't been to France in fifteen years, and who knows (especially after this trip) when I will go again.

Get to the number on my license. More »New Year's ResolutionsA Second Look at the Death PenaltySusan Estrich - Wed, Dec 28, 2011I still remember back in 1988 sitting in a Chinese restaurant when then-Governor Bill Clinton took a napkin and listed on one side the Democratic governors who were against the death penalty and, on the other, those who were for it. In its time, the issue was the third rail in American politics — the line that divided those who could win because they were considered tough on crime and those who would face electoral problems. A few years later, my friend Kathleen Brown was trounced in the governor's race in California in large part because she opposed the death penalty. More »A Second Look at the Death PenaltyReality BitesSusan Estrich - Fri, Dec 23, 2011The Gingrich balloon is leaking air. He is beginning to look more and more like Howard Dean. The latest Rasmussen caucus poll shows him dropping three points behind Mitt Romney (23 to 20) after leading him by 13 points (32-19) just a month ago.  More »Reality BitesChristmas ChoicesSusan Estrich - Wed, Dec 21, 2011Right around now is when people start fretting over creches in the public square and arguing as to whether publicly funded Christmas symbols violate the establishment clause of the First Amendment. And right about now is also when certain Jewish groups begin insisting that the answer is to place a Hanukkah menorah right next to that creche, which leads atheists to complain about a plague on both their houses.

More »Welcome HomeThe New Chelsea ClintonSusan Estrich - Wed, Dec 14, 2011Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton's debut on NBC's "Nightly News" is drawing plenty of attention, as well it should. Since her father's election nearly 20 years ago, the Clintons set an example of real family values by doing everything they could to keep Chelsea out of the spotlight and allow her to live as normal of a life as possible. By all outside indicators, it worked. She has grown up to be a young woman of intelligence, character and commitment. The press, for its part, pretty much left her alone. More »The New Chelsea ClintonThe New FrontrunnerSusan Estrich - Fri, Dec 9, 2011It was just at this time in 2003 — on December 9th, to be exact — that former Vice President Al Gore endorsed insurgent candidate Howard Dean, making him the official frontrunner and nominee-apparent in the Democratic race for the president. Looking back, many people said the endorsement was the kiss of death, but that wasn't really the case. Gore — then and now — was much respected in the Democratic Party, and any serious candidate would welcome his endorsement, not to mention the support of his former aides and backers.

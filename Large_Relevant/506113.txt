Ob-gyns sound alarm on "contraceptive sabotage"By Genevra Pittman | Reuters – Wed, Jan 23, 2013

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Doctors should ask teen girls and women whether their partners are trying to force them to get pregnant or otherwise "reproductively coercing" them, according to a group of ob-gyns.
              That could include pressuring women to have sex - possibly without a condom or other birth control, forcing them to continue (or end) a pregnancy or intentionally exposing them to sexually transmitted infections, according to The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).
              "What we're talking about is specific to women and girls' ability to contracept, to control their reproductive health," said Jay Silverman, who studies violence against women at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine.
              "What we've found is that many male partners are more actively involved than we would have thought in really blocking women and girls' ability to do that, as a form of control that's part of a larger picture of violence against women and girls," added Silverman, who wasn't part of the ACOG committee.
              One study of the National Domestic Violence Hotline found a fourth of callers had experienced reproductive coercion.
              "All the different forms of violence and coercion of women and girls from male partners are based in the entitlement to control their lives, physically and otherwise," Silverman said. "They also feel entitled to decide whether she's going to get pregnant or not."
              The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports close to three in 10 U.S. women have experienced rape, stalking or physical violence by a partner. Other studies suggest as many as half of women will experience psychological aggression from an intimate partner at some point in their lives.
              OFFERING ‘SAFE SPACE'
              Earlier this month, the government-backed U.S. Preventive Services Task Force called on doctors to screen women of childbearing age for domestic violence and refer those who need it to intervention services.
              "I think this is a very common problem - it's extremely underreported," said Dr. Eduardo Lara-Torre, a member of the ACOG committee from the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine, of reproductive coercion.
              In cases of reproductive coercion or "contraceptive sabotage," the ob-gyn group said doctors can help women obtain safe and concealable birth control, such as emergency contraceptive pills packaged in plain envelopes or intrauterine devices with trimmed strings.
              Doctors can also give women safety cards, hotline numbers and referrals to domestic violence services, according to the committee opinion published in Obstetrics & Gynecology.
              "For this particular scenario, (doctors need to) be able to offer them a safe space to discuss it, number one… as well as offer them alternatives and strategies so they don't get sabotaged," Lara-Torre told Reuters Health
              In addition, he said, doctors should "offer them help and assistance, including shelters, for whatever else they might need."
              Silverman agreed that doctors and other clinic staff should ask women and girls about reproductive coercion, especially when they come to the office for contraception.
              "It is incredibly important that these are issues that are asked about, because if we don't understand the context in which a woman is attempting to contracept, then we are not often giving her the tools to be effective to do that," he told Reuters Health.
              "It may be that she needs a long-acting control method that her partner has no control over and may not be able to detect."

Dozens of lawsuits have been filed by faith-affiliated charities, hospitals and universities, against the mandate which requires employers to provide insurance that covers contraception for free.  However, many for-profit business owners are also suing, claiming a violation of their religious beliefs. The religious lawsuits have largely stalled, as the Department of Health and Human Services tries to develop an accommodation for faith groups. However, no such offer will be made to individual business owners. And their lawsuits are yielding conflicting rulings in appeals courts around the country.

Let's face it,this has been going on forever and its shameful that the problem is just now being talked about. I know that if men had to experience childbirth or a heavy period,our population would plummet. Young girls are being pressured like never before to have sex,mostly unprotected. We need better sex education,better access to birth control, and we should raise children to be more secure in their own sexuality.

No woman should have to stay with an abusive partner or be forced to have children by him. "Covert contraception" should only be a temporary measure while she plans her escape.

They also usually have very low self esteem which makes them ripe for the picking by abusers.

Reproductive sabotage works both ways.  I once had a girl intentionally get pregnant when she swore she was on the pill.  for some reason, she thought i would propose to her.  that's not what happened.  it all ended very badly.

Why cant they, for once, make an article about men's reproductive rights. I mean it's terrible...I feel so oppressed,  women force sex on me several times a day. It's terrible. Its like im a kept man. They insist i don't work, have everything given too me and order me to receive blow j@bs all the time. Between session they make me watch football, porn, Nascar, war movies and always suggest that we invite other women in for a threesome. I only have time left for hanging out at the hardware and gun store. My life sucks. What do I do ?

This danger is growing more and more affecting girls at a younger age. The more women gain in power, prestige and equality the more men, specially younger men feel threatened. I don't know a woman alive who, if she is honest, has not been abused verbally, psychologically, emotionally, physically or sexually at one time or another.

what bothers me about this article is that it is just being reported on, it has been going on forever. but that it is being talked about now is especially frustrating with what is happening in the political world in reference to birth control & abortion; planned parenthood is being attacked (when most of their services are of the contraception & female health issues, but being construed as abortion), different state's legislatures are passing laws that make the middle ages seem enlightened & girls & women are being told that having babies is all they need...to make them complete.

Doing a "raw dog" should be  a FELONY with mandatory hard time.

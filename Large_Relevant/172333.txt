Before 9/11 there have never been any instances of a building falling from a fire, which is the official reason the towers collapsed. After 9/11 there indeed has been one recorded building falling in the same exact manner as the towers did and was officially stated it was due to fire and structural integrity. This building was WTC #7. Wake up retard.

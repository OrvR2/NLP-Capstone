And all birds evolved from dinosaurs. x
If you want to see living dinosaur legs, take a look Ostrich / Rhea legs. x

Most monkeys aren't meat eats.
They didn't need to follow the herds, or learn to hunt. They just sit all day eating tons of vegetation.
And to survive on vegetation means that all youďťż do all day is eat, no time for anything else. Meat is the most efficient form of energy, and boost brain growth.

Because you assume humans > monkeys. Place a human in a jungle full of predators, and suddenly what makes the human "superior" would just cause them to look way inferior to aďťż chimpanzee. We can't climb trees for a damn, we're incredibly slow, we're tall so we're easy to spot, we have a terrible sense of smell, and it takes YEARS and years for babies to develop.
Every species has different strengths and weaknesses, and it is foolishness to believe that humans are somehow far superior.

No, humans are superior. Your argument justďťż takes one thing out of place and puts it somewhere else. Just like "Oh if we take a shark out of water, and put it in a forest full of squirrels, the squirrels are clearly the better". Humans are at the top because we can use and develop tools. We have far much more power than any other species on earth right now. Not trying to sound arrogant, but it's true.

Hi! I reallyďťż like your channel. So much, in fact, that you inspired me to make one of my school projects using your technique - drawing on a whiteboard and such. Just wondering if you could tell me how you do it? I get the basic concept of drawing on a whiteboard, filming it, then speeding it up, but are there any specifics? Thanks!

I think he might speed up theďťż recording of his voice, too. And he might delete some of the moments of silence between his words/sentences.
Audacity is a great, free program for editing audio.
Also, great userpic. I love UP.

Don't forget theďťż definition of a chicken. Chickens evolved from jungle fowl. (Still alive today) and just like the wolves and dogs we created a whole new species. So do you consider the jungle fowl or the farm chicken to be the first chicken

Well no, like he said.. A "funky" bird laid the egg, and the egg hatched to a different breed maybe because there was a different Gene introduced.. Or even simpler, two different types of birds mated and laid the egg to make the chicken... andďťż ofc in a nest there is usually more than one egg and so then the chicken reproduced and adapted through the years.. ?

The egg didn't come first. Because he was deeper inďťż his construction without the results of therefore Christ. This is the thought for you if you are as well a believer where did God come from? The Bible says all men are created in His likeness; a fitting image that compliments the true omniscient! Believer do you have other beliefs? The son of God really was sent for his prophecy as Babylon for us adversely. Why doesn't God try to make us believe in the ordination, Christ?

I have a question.
what do you say about Al-Qurâaan, the main source of the Islamic faith, is aďťż book believed by Muslims, to be of completely Divine origin. Muslims also believe that it
contains guidance for all mankind.

Hello, I love your videos.
However at 2:07 you say that the chicken andďťż the "proto-chicken" are the same.
So then the proto-chicken must have came first. from an egg?
All of you fast talking and explaining didn't touch the real issue of the question.
where did the (proto)chicken/egg come from?

ŰThats not what theyre trying to explain,but I still agree the vid didntďťż solve the riddle. x
But I dont think the riddle has an answer. Because the prob of the question is 1 of definitions. x
Lets use a good example in the vid. x
Lets say an elephant lays an egg. Inside the egg is a lion. x
Now the prob. Is that egg an... elephant egg? Or is it a lion egg? x
Its an issue of labels. Is it an elephant egg because of where it came from? Or is it a lion egg because of what it contains? Well? x

ŰThat's a problem with words. x
Basically this discussion about chicken eggs/chicken breaks down because our words/labels that we use to name creatures are inexact. x
For example,in Nature: When EXACTLYďťż does a hill become a mountain. Or when EXACTLY does green become blue. Or when EXACTLY does a sea become an ocean.
Thats the same problem with defining things like species in evolution. Like chickens. As they are part of nature too. x
So,chickens can mate with their close enough ancestors. x

ŰYeah, all life is related.ďťż All creatures are like very distant cousins. x
Some are closer,like chimpanzees at 98% the same DNA as us. x
Birds came from dinosaurs. If you look at dinosaur legs, and bird legs, you can see it. Especially the Ostrich. x
And right, technically, there is no first human, or first baby. x
Since humans came from earlier apes, & those earlier apes came from earlier primates, and so on, and so on. x
It's a big chain of life. 4.5 billion years old is the Earth. x

First, an elephant cannot lay an egg. Second even if an elephant could, a lion wouldn't hatch from the egg because they are DIFFERENT species.ďťż A chicken could lay an egg and a chicken would hatch from that egg because they are the SAME species.
Scientists believe that birds evolved from small dinosuars which means a small dinosaur evolved into a chicken, mated with another of it's kind and laid the first chicken egg. Thus the chicken came first.

@MayhamsLikeMe but as a member of the science community, you know how strict of a process it is to get something published, let alone accepted by other colleagues. Even if you do everything right you still might not even make it past the peer-review step. The stuffďťż that makes textbooks has an even more of a burden, but its stuff that has typically withstood the test of time, which is ridiculously hard when every other scientist is trying to prove you wrong.

I think it largely depends on what side of the dollar you're on. Global warming is a bunch of malarkey, but Al Gore manages to push his environmental agendas with no problem. Seems like at thisďťż point, if you have enough money and a decent theory, which can't be disproved, people will eat it right up.
Darwin was definitely on to something when he observed some form of natural selection, I just think he applied it incorrectly.

Yeah Al Gore probably gives climatologists a bad rap. But I think if there was a significant flaw with Darwin's work we would have noticed by now. Instead it's just the contrary. It's continually being verified further and has hardly been revised at all. I mean talk about a theory that many would love to discount...yet it remains the only theory to explain the biodiversity we see. Iďťż do see what you're saying about money causing bad science, but done right, it's quite an elegant thing.

You're talking about the natural selection of certain traits that increase the fitness of a specific animal within it's environment. You can't measure or observe these rates of change. Additionally, there's no proof that those finches are reproductively isolated. Darwin noted different beaksďťż specialized for eating different types of food. You can't observe macro-evolution, period. There's no arguing that. Micro-evolution can be observed in micro-organisms. But that's it.

At the very least, inďťż can be inferred. Do you not believe the current theory of evolution is enough to explain all the biodiversity we see today? The evidence seems overwhelming to me...even common sense. After all there aren't any other rival theories founded in science. What do you believe?

I don't think inference is enough to prove or disprove anything. I think that micro-evolution is enough to explain all the diversity we see today. I don't think there's any realďťż evidence that can prove that macro-evolution ever occurred. And, I believe what God provided us with in the Bible. I just have a problem with people claiming that macro-evolution definitely occurred. It's not a law like the Law of Thermodynamics. It's a theory, and it's yet to be proved by anyone.

That's fair. While I do think your religious views may be clouding your judgement, you're by far the most logical creationistďťż I've ever spoken to. Even the ones who claim to be educated typically dish out misrepresented facts and pseudo-scientific "evidence" that has clearly come from a biased source. That's why I like science...it's unbiased. It often gives answers that are wildly unpopular, but it doesn't lie. Do you have a science degree? Just curious

Drew unlike gravity most of evolution can't be observed, or at least hasn't yet. The few that have creationist generally agree with, but hold different theoretical reasons for those. Measured is probably about the same for both camps so I won't go into that. And proven that's a laugh, the only few proven ways of makingďťż fossils for instance happen really fast and under right conditions can be about a year. Neither is anyone even close to knowing how life was made, most test have failed miserabl

Ah let them have their religious beliefs and If they want to whole hardly believe inďťż evolution despite ever looking at the many flaws and counter theories let them keep those religious ideals. They'll sadly end up learning the truth sooner or later and hey maybe God did do it that way, but looking at several things in science I doubt it.

I think that two different animals that have been extinct for a long time had intercourse,then the female laid an egg. The baby was an animal that was close to the chicken. Then that animal had intercourse with another animal. The female laid an egg which was the chicken. Then they had another baby which was also a chicken. Those two had intercourse and had more baby's. This went on for a long time until there were a whole bunch of chickens. So, it was the egg that came first. I'm 12ďťż by the way.

I mean really,ďťż on a channel named "asapSCIENCE", they still come and comment about how they find it more easy to take in that their fairytale is real, so they`ll just act like it`s real and because of that, science can go to hell and they`ll just believe whatever FEELS RIGHT.

You mayďťż think I`m mocking you right now, but frankly, I`m not. I`m merely stating a few other examples that fit in the same category of possibility as your "option", since neither of them has any proof to support the existence of, nor against it.
How about we leave aside the "Hey, it`s possible ............." and use something closer to reality, hmm ... ? Science for example!

ŰGod... or the big bang? x
If the choicesďťż are a "ridiculous magical sky daddy wizard" fairy tale... or something else... x
Well, the first choice is obviously made up. x
God is just like Santa Claus, or leprechauns, or how people tried to explain lightning with gods throwing thunder bolts, back when people were ignorant of good explanations. x
Well, it can't be that choice for sure. x
So the answer must be big bang or I don't know. Make believe gods it ain't. x

Buddy, your entire world is gonna get turned upside-down when you get to college. I can't believe how sheltered the people on here are. When you all get to college, it's gonna be a serious wake-up call. That big, scary thing called "evolution" is something you'll be expected to have a firm understanding of. You'll learn it, be tested on it and build projects around it. Biology has changedďťż alot since your parents learned it. If you're still under the idea there's no "proof", bio 101 is gonna suck

You mean that theory of evolution thing? That theory? The one that they force onto children in school? That must be the one you're talking about. There is no proof that any kind of macro-evolution takes place. Remember, friend. Theory isn't law.ďťż It's theory.

Correct, a theory, by definition,ďťż can not be proven. However, the underlying principles can be. Take gravity for example...just a theory, and no one knows why it happens. But we can observe it, measure it...we can prove its equation, we can prove it distorts space-time, etc. Evolution's underlying principles can be observed, measured and proven

LOL you just went full retarded. sickle sell anaemia is a disease and natural selection is not supposed to bring a disease, itďťż is supposed to improve the future progeny. it SELECTS THE FITTEST living things to survive. as these FIT ones supposedly acquired new features that worked to their ADVANTAGE. do you think people with sickle cell anaemia are fit?

YOU went full retarded. Sickle cell anemiaďťż is taught in all introductory courses in genetics, a classics example of how human genetic disease can have selective advantage. go and learn it yourself about how it can lower the mortality rate in Africa, dumbass.

hahaha, exactly the opposite happens in my religion, i am christian. i CAN ask and i have askedďťż questions regarding the religion and god himself and they have kindly showed me the answers from the bible and not from their own mouth. we see science as something that helps us understand how god did it. i am aware that christendom is not really following the bible and being total hypocrites. but not my religion cause it is different from other christian denominations

The bible was written by man, and the whole concept ofďťż god was created by man. The accounts in the bible, for example genesis is wrong and has been disproven by science & evolution.
Science does not help you understand how "god did it", because god did not do it, god is a fairy tail. Instead science helps you understand how we came to exist by a purely natural process, and as we progress in our scientific knowledge we will continue to disclose more and more about how it all came to be.

it will be in vain sadly. bible prophecies did actually happen for example the prophecy of the fall of babylon. details were given as to how it would happen, prophesied in Isaiah (13:19; 14:22,23) isaiah's prophecy even named the king who would conquer babylon ( kingďťż Cyrus of Persia). and all this was prophesied 200 years before the fall of babylon. and they did it without battle! and Mathew 15:9 will help you understand what is happening in christendom.

Oh the prophecies, BTW could these get anymore vague? The prophecies are more like observations. I've had the joy of being hit with these by street thumpers, and door to door bible peddlers.
I just read 13:20 "It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it beďťż dwelt in from generation to generation"
Well guess what? That's wrong, I just looked on google maps and found that it is inhabited. Just FYI ancient babylon is in the center of modern iraq.

i think since it has become a tourist and archaeological site people might have actually settled there but the fall of babylon by the king of persia was fullfilled. how can it be an observation if it was foretold 200 years before the actual event? and plus i like your enthusiasm on how quick you are to proveďťż everything wrong by researching so i would like to point out something to you.....evolution they say started from non living things like rocks! have you ever noticed that?

just because something happened doesn't mean it was destined to be.
1.ďťż then who created your god?
2. the bible describes the world as flat, science has shown its round as well as other various things that disprove the bible, like the bible says women will suffer excruciating pain when in labor, yet african women don't even suffer to that extent of "excruciating", science has shown that its the large hips that ease the pain
3. you are aware todays morals are far different than the bible's right?

1. in mythology someone created god or gods. but the real god existed from time indefinite, king of eternity (1 Timothy 1:17, Rev 15:3,ďťż Psalm 90:2, Isaiah 45:18)
2. Isaiah 40:22 "there is One who is dwelling above the CIRCLE of the Earth". Job 26:7 "he is stretching out the north over the empty place, Hanging the EARTH UPON NOTHING;" All women who have wider hips than their counterparts have this advantage which is genetic or hereditary.
3. people today have no moral, or very less of it.

2. job? you really wanna bring up the story where a faithful follower was tortured for keeping faith?
3. people today have far more morals now than they ever have, today women have rights to vote, gays rights are being discussed, i have far more rights to not be harmed by police when its unnecessary, etc. while your god, yahweh, calls for deaths of nonbelievers, and deviants.
I'm sorry if you think its immoral but the world is progressing

People who believe in evolution are blind. Though it is true that creatures adapt, they do not completely change into another creature. And ifďťż they adapt to better fit the environment, then if we came from apes, why would something become weaker. Apes are way stronger than humans so why do we still have apes and why would they become a weak human?

Yes this guy is a good example. I did look him up and sure enough he has a PhD and he thinks the earth is the center of the universe and everything evolves around us including the sun. He's a member of someďťż Creation Research Society. People like this cannot accept the bible being incorrect so they do anything they can to distort science in attempt to align it with the scripture. They selectively ignore facts already very very well established.

Evolution may be viewed as a scientific fact, but so are physics and quantum mechanics.ďťż Both of which work on their own, but not when applying one to the other; even though they should, because they are both scientific facts. They are viewed as facts because that is all we are capable of understanding at the present. Remember, nothing can be totally proven or disproven.

But you forget what a fact is, a fact can be proven or disproven, if it cant be neither it is not a fact and doesnt apply on reality. That gravity is real can be proven, the fossil's age can be proven, the color on your underphats can be proven, these are all facts cuz it can be proven. Or rather, its a claimed fact until you have proven it. Gods existence, cant be proven. Itďťż is not real. It cant be disproven, but it is still not real.

I was using the word fact in response to multiple comments in which people were saying evolution is a fact (people that don't know what they are talking about). If speaking scientifically the proper term is law, and all a scientific law does is simply states that something occurs repeatedly the same way. A fact can not be disproved, because it is by definition is something indisputable. Saying something can not be proven is hardly enough to say it is not real. The origin of lifeďťż cant be proven.

Evolution can and has been proven throught various experiments. Adam and Eve however can not be proven. You can't disprove that we emerged from a rotten rats ass either but for those problems we use common sense on what seems likely. If we allowed things that cant be disproven to be fact then it allowes for lots of crazy and stupid mythology to be considered a fact. Prove to me that Thor doesn't exist. You can't but you still know he doesn't. The sameďťż rule applies to the christian god and allah.

this video is bullocks, how can you say that a proto-egg and a chicken-egg are both eggs, but you do not say that a proto-chicken is a chicken??? in both versions you can argue that the chicken came first (even if that means that that "chicken" was a "proto-chicken) I can notďťż agree on your point that a proto-chicken isn't as much of a chicken as a chicken, when a protoegg is the same as and chicken egg (they are both eggs that came from a chicken right?)

You`re looking at the problem as a 3-step cycle, when it`s actually a 2-step cycle, as stated in the question. You have the egg and the chicken and the only link between them is either:
1. egg-chicken, as in, the egg that hatched the first chicken
2. chicken-egg, as in, the chicken that laid the first egg
Since chickens come from eggs, it`s clear that the first option is the right one. What laid that egg that mutated and created the first chicken, is irrelevant. The egg came first.ďťż

Actually, it does. It`s not science`s fault you`re ignorantďťż and don`t know, don`t want to know, or you`re incapable of learning.
Evolution refers only to how life forms came to be in the form we see today. The beginning and how, is a different thing and it`s called abiogenesis, which proven that life can emerge from non-life elements in natural conditions with natural elements -- look up the Urey-Miller experiment and please .. for the sake of all of us and most of all, YOU .. Educate yourself.

Actually it has been proven that chickens are related to the t rex, so after millions ofbyears of evolution, the t rex produced a subspiecies called the chicken,ďťż so since t rex were laying eggs before the chicken, the egg came first

technically the egg, because dinosaurs came to be over millions of years through expanding bacteria, and the elements foundďťż in all basic instincts of the creation of life, and through the A-Sexual reproduction of cells and molecules. to evolve into the egg laying dinosaurs you would have found 250 million years ago. so to answer your question: bacteria formed the original evolutionary "eggs" so i guess thats your answer, the egg came before the T rex

It's obvious the egg came first; the zygote that led to the first Chicken had to fosterďťż the growth of the creature and for that to happen, it needs to be in an egg or have come from an egg, even if it wasn't a traditional chicken egg, the first chicken came from AN egg which it grew from.

Thanks for the information!!! I didn't word my question about fire correctly, i meant why does fire have the shape that it does and make it have a distinguishable look as a flame, if it's just light then why doesnt it just glow likeďťż a light bulb or something, why does it flicker and look likes flames, why does the light arrange itself into that particular flame. hahaha i don't really know how to word it so none of that will probably make sense, but yeah.

Such a great example of a god fearing theist following Jesus` example of love, care, humility etc etc ...
If you`re not prepared to defend your belief, don`t voice it. Keep it to yourself and nobody will ever bother you with questions about it. It`s really that simple.
And yes, you are obliged to defend it. You would knowďťż that if you`d actually read the Bible, which you ... clearly didn`t. It`s right there at 1 Peter 3:15 and Matthew 5:41.

To all of you that are simply saying "it was god" good for you for having you beliefs, but that doesn't mean that they are correct. You have to be open to other people's theory's and ideas. Is there anything to prove that god made all animals, not saying that maybe he didnt. What makes your opinion/beliefs better than someone who believesďťż in evolutionary facts?

Let me put it in a way you might .... just might ... understand this really simple, yet hard for a theist [ since it challenges his beliefs ] matter.
If a math book would have on all the pages 2+2=5 [ all pages as in, not a typing mistake once ] andďťż went on with that to teach you linear equations, would you trust that book, knowing that 2+2 is in fact 4 and not 5, would you trust the rest of it to be accurate and worthy of memorizing / taking for granted? No, of course not. Same with the Bible.

Reflex response dating back to our predecessors before civilization and creation of a peaceful society. When cornered, a mammal or any living creature will make loud noises in attempt to scare away predators. You can also see it inďťż other animals such as racoons.

Left handed people use the right side of their brain whereas it's the opposite for right handed individuals. For left handed people though, there's a 40% chanceďťż of using both sides of their brain by passing information between them. This leads to more creativity and novel connections. Also, left-handed people type slower I think

wtf are you smoking? Everybody uses both sides of their brainďťż and every brain passes information between the two hemispheres via corpus callosum. The left hemisphere controls the right side of the body and viceversa as shown in stroke victims.

You can't take the bible literally. Genesis 1:20 "And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life..." which science has already confirmed is true as the first "living creature" was a mitochondria within water because water is essential to all life and provides easy transportationďťż of nutrients. Of which if God created mitochondria, he created everything else.

If a species start form another species, the "original" species turns into the "new" . Little changes start from a generation to another and one day the diferences will be so visibles that the "original" starts to be considered another species or a extintďťż species.
Just like we humans. Years ago the humans were born with closed eyes, and then, after weeks they were open. But now after hours the eyes are open. Same with the wisdom tooth who appears later than a few generations ago.

Evolution is actually regarded a scientific fact, because it has been observedďťż that species do change over time, and it is the theories that just explain how. So no matter what you believe in, the world as a whole agrees in evolution.

The "proto-chicken" is simply a theory of Mr. AsapScience's. All scientists believe in evolution, and the porto-chicken is a theory, so that he can create a scenario. However, just as many other species and races in history, IF the proto-chickens were real,ďťż they are most likely extinct.

These 2 bits alone (and more, of course) show evolution is the best scientific answer, and the Bible's Genesis story is the fairy tale. x

Right. My bad on that.ďťż But my point stands, since you attacked waterdragon`s comment, whether you want to take it as a fact or as an opinion, because you have a different opinion.
So again, the point stands. You`re still a hypocrite for replying in the first place. If you`d really keep it to yourself, you`d shrug it off and move on -- but you didn`t, did you now ... ? Of course not :) You voiced yours while asking him to keep his to himself.
Now ... move along ...

This brings forth the question, what exactly is a "fact"? Something we all know to be true? Based on what? Our senses? The existence of the Earth being flat was a "fact", but it was proven wrong. Itďťż was said to be a fact, and because of popular consensus it became a fact. But then that fact was proven wrong. The idea had no evidence other than it seems flat as we travel. Whereas the "theory" had evidence. I honestly think theories are superior.

To be a theory, it has to have sufficient evidence and be realistic. By saying it's "just a theory" you're suggesting that there's something beyond a theory. What exactly is beyond a theory? Real actual things like cows or chickens? Well, the idea of a cow actually falls under the definition.
It's been hypothesized that cows exist, because our senses tell us they're there. We've tested their existence by touching them. We have enough evidence toďťż support the hypothesis.
There's nothing beyond.

Quit voicing your opinion like that without evidence. Also, do you even know the definition of a scientific theory?
Definition of scientific theory from Livesciencedotcom:
"A scientific theory summarizes a hypothesis or group of hypotheses that have been supported with repeated testing. If enough evidence accumulates to support a hypothesis, it moves to the next stepâknown as a theoryâinďťż the scientific method and becomes accepted as a valid explanation of a phenomenon."

I don't think you read my reply. Re-read this part "the mere fact that it possessed some unusual features does not prove that reptiles evolved into birds" And for the crosso- something, I would like to hear it before you can officially use that for the argument.
Still, whadaheck, Iďťż have 200 characters... ill continue... DNA is just too damn complex for evolution to happen, but if it wasn't, natural selection would kill the mutants long before they could re-produce and mutate again.. and so on

Alright, here is the part where the transition of amphibian to reptile part goes off. Animals that lay eggs in the water have a special gel that the egg won't "drown" in water, and the animals thatďťż lay them on land don't have it, but simply have a hard shell. So, if an animal that just came out of the water try to lay eggs on dry land, the "gel egg" would die. same thing if an amphibian that normally lays eggs in the water would suddenly lay them on land, Blegh, you get the point

Yes, but what you say here is not possible. Macro evolutionďťż is not psooible. A mutation is possible but only in a micro evolution way. This is scientificly proven. if there was a mutation in the egg it wouldnt be able te evolve into a chicken. only into a different kind of duck if the egg came from a duck. And even if this happend it would still need a partner to mate with. so there has to be another chicken around. Remember evolution is just a theory, not a fact. And I dont believe it.

Well the question is: how do you want macro evolution to occure? Animals get an extra organ? Mutation can show up in the DNA. this can make for slight changes like colourblindness or imuun to poison etc. But a mutation can only replace parts of the DNA. it can cut parts or copy parts. But it can never input newďťż genetic information. So this means macro evolution is not possible.

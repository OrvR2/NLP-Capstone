The LORD is about to shut the door on The Ark of HIS Grace. When this happens The Flood of Great Destruction will sweep across the whole world { Rev. 6-17 }. A persons Obedience to Romans 10:9 &10 will ensure then entrance into The Ark. Do NOT delay to come on board. Today is The Day of Salvation.The Gift of GOD is Eternal Life ( Romans 6:23b ) It is﻿ The Will of GOD? in Christ that all be Saved (1 Timothy 2: 4 & 5 ) GET SAVED TODAY you may not have another opportunity to do so MARANATHA-Amen

This is totally a false flag situation, designed to make people think we need to ban fire. fire doesn't kill people, crazy people kill people, minorities kill people, video﻿ games kill people, gremlins kill people, zionists kill people, muslims kill people, religious people kill people, athiests kill people, but most of all, obama kills people, because he's born in kenya and in kenya they teach their young to eat their way out of their mother's womb, or chest cavity. Aliens kill people!

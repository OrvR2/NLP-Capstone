Brazil's nightclub fire

    A night of tragedy  


Jan 27th 2013, 21:30 by H.J. | SÃO PAULO



Tweet
 


 

THE death toll from a fire that broke out in the early hours of January 27th in a Brazilian nightclub has already reached 232, with more than 100 injured, many severely. Almost all the victims were young; the nightclub, Kiss, in the university town of Santa Maria in the far southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, was popular with students. Most of the deaths were from smoke inhalation and asphyxiation.Some survivors were flown to neighbouring cities, including the state capital, Porto Alegre, for treatment. A sports centre in Santa Maria was hastily turned into a makeshift morgue. It is customary in Brazil for burials to be held within 24 hours of death; the high death toll may mean mass funerals too.Questions are being asked about the quality of the nightclub building and whether emergency procedures were followed. The blaze appears to have been started by a pyrotechnic flare lit on stage by a member of the band; sound-proofing material caught fire, producing toxic gases which quickly overpowered many in the crowd. Police said that at least one exit was blocked. Television stations broadcast images of firefighters, helped by bystanders, breaking through a wall to get in. Some of the victims were found in the bathrooms, possibly because they mistook them for emergency exits, and were then unable to come back out through the panicked crowds.It was reported that the club’s Fire Prevention and Control Plan expired last year. This may not be significant: renewing business licences of any sort can be slow in Brazil, and businesses can usually continue to operate legally while waiting, provided they have submitted their request in time. But firefighters and police said they would be investigating whether exits had been locked illegally, whether the venue was overcrowded and whether its safety equipment was working. A fire extinguisher used to try to put out the blaze when it started appears to have been out of order.Brazilian bars typically provide a numbered ticket on entry, which is used to place orders during the night, with payment upon leaving. Investigators will also want to know whether bouncers initially impeded escape, assuming that people were simply trying to leave without paying.The scale of the tragedy, and the youth of the victims, have shocked Brazil. Dilma Rousseff, Brazil's president, cut short a visit to Chile, where she was attending a summit between European and Latin American countries, and flew directly to Santa Maria. Rio Grande do Sul is a relatively prosperous state, with good hospitals and health-care infrastructure, but she promised that the federal government would give any help required in the continued search for bodies and the treatment of those injured. "I want to say to the people of our country and the people of Santa Maria that in this moment of sadness, we are together," she said through tears before boarding her plane.

I noticed how some Brasileiro readers become very defensive.  Don't want to admit that the system is rotten to the core.  Soccer, carnival, caipirinha, coddling criminals...that's the Brazilian wayl.  Of course, many nationalities are like this.   Many endearing features too.  National tragedy followed by laws that never get implemented.  "Jeitinho Brasileiro"  ( "Brazilian Way")  is something Brasileiros are proud of, they think it's cute to be able to get their own way, irrespective of laws or the good of society.  The mayor failed, the inspectors failed, the owners failed.  No one will be punished for long or at all.  Brazil should be doing better.  I agree with the term 'complacency' used below.    Football, carnival, caipirinha for all!

It was really a tragedy. 200-plus lives lost. My sincere condolences to all of those youngsters' families. I cannot imagine the pain they are feeling. Unfortunately this kind of disaster is what we may call an easily foretold tragedy quite common in Brazil and will not be the last. And the reason why it was easily foretold is because the Brazilian public institutions do not work at all and when they rarely do they move at a snail's pace. How many similar venues are up-to-scratch in Brazil, I mean, following all the safety procedures? And what about the hotels, restaurants, public buildings and so on? Very few I am sure. The point here is that too many in Brazil know they can count on the customary failures of its public institutions to get away with things like that. After all, its legal system is a laughing stock. How many will end up in jail for this disaster? Nobody.

I have just returned from Rio and was staying in a large apartment building on the 12th floor. I was struck that the design of the building and the fire precautions in place would have proved inadequate in the event of a major fire. The bureaucracy in Brazil is formidable and legendary -- already in this tragedy the buck-passing has begun.

Just a question: People don't get tired of disgusting, fascistoid comments ??!! I know that The Economist is a conservative magazine and yet, deserving full respect. But half-dozen amongst its "would be readers" go too far and start to instill, to secrete their venom full of prejudice, hate, profound ignorance, poor or none experience in knowing about/traveling around the world, with their senses actually turned on. Especially knowing about and traveling trough 1) developed countries, all of them peopled by 100% of citizens always "working very hard and fighting tightly to improve their societies" and 2) developing countries, always full of people "lazy and passive". Give us a break, please! Especially those, in this report, part of a very small group (but very active in the web, indeed) of unhappy, frustrated Brazilians, gifted with the worse of the inferiority complexes, always bullying their own pals and their cheerful and promising country, if not the entire world.

It's really disappointing here to see some comments especially coming from antiBr who no matter what will criticize not in a constructive manner. It was a huge disaster that chocked the whole nation and now we are trying to make our way through this and take the appropiate action. Brazil has many issues, that's true, but now it's more important to be a human being and try to support the region and the families who lost their beloved ones instead of swearing the government and the nation. Efforts have been made from the government to not repeat this situation, but as it was said in the comments even in the US this incident happened already. Living this tragedy does not relate to being a third world country, it only relates with how human can we be to help people from that city and try to avoid these accidents again. You're not helping James antibr, so please you would help us brazilians if you kept quiet about it.

According to Santa Maria's Mayor Cesar  Schmier, his mind is "at ease" with the club
fulfilling its regulations obligations.
http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/30/us-brazil-nightclub-idUSBRE90T...
Really?
No sprinkler system (else, the fire would be terminated quickly)
No clearly marked exit doors or fire escape plan (on top of that the main entrance was blocked
by the Security personnel).
Brazil, a third world country, that wants you to believe it has grown up to emerging global power.

My God... it's unbelievable how many people think they always have the right thing to say about Brazil in situations like this. I am brazilian, I live in Brazil. I'm a mother of a 21 years old boy, the same age of so many of those who died. I am devastated. I'm from the state  of  São Paulo and I can't even imagine the pain of those parents. Please... have some respect. I know, more then anyone in the world, everything that is wrong in my country, believe me .... I know! I live here! But we are in pain for our brothers and sisters of Santa Maria. And this is who we are, well, at least this is who I am. I'm not ashamed of Brazil, never! And for the people who always has the solution for everything that is wrong in Brazil: well do something! Maybe I will vote for you in the next presidential election.

First we will be shocked and after is ever the same thing: months, years to looking for solutions, and nothing effectively made! Corruption, acidents, deads, crimes, all over these disaster are repeating year after year! I'm embarrased because some people like me, that think, study and looking for qualification, in the same level of rich nations, will pay for this image!

Besides having my post deleted and plagerized (first few
lines), all I can say that Brazilians don't like their B.S (Brazilian Sugarcoating).
(1)Investigate Marco Aurelio Garcia (another Brazilian
tragedy) to get the gist of how authorities deal with
Brazilians in Brazil.
(2)The stuff I posted here (lack of sprinklers, blocked
exits, etc. is what makes Brazil a third world nation
desperately trying to be a major power).
(3)The tragedy happened in one of the wealthiest areas of
Brazil with a high concentration of European descendants.
Imagine in other areas.

James AntiBr,
     Why do you bully Brazil like this?
     What you are saying makes no sense what so ever. I live in Warwick, Rhode Island, right next to West Warwick, Rhode Island, we had a fire here exactly like the one in Santa Maria, 103 people died here, in the United States of America, a 1st World country. In the Rhode Island fire, over crowding, blocked exits, flammable acoustic foaming, no sprinklers, illegal pyrotechnics set the place on fire, the majority of the victims were trapped and died in the bathrooms... sounds familiar! I never heard anyone calling the United States a 3rd world country because of that...
    Perhaps you British are particular ticked off about the fact that Brazil's economy took that of the UK as the 6th largest in the world, and I have been seeing a rather peculiar harsh tone from your country men lately... coincidence!! I don't think so...
    Get a grip buddy, Brazil has been a powerful country for a long while now, with or without it's problems, it will continue to push forward...
    By the way, I love and admire the United Kingdom very much, love the British, love your people and culture, but I do feel sorry for arrogant English people that feel the need to put Brazil down at the first chance they get, regardless of their reasoning... 
Cheers!!

We have to agree to disagree Mr James,
The resons you have given in order to determine whether  Brazil is a third world country may as well be taken into consideration but in this case the UK would have to be downgraded to a second if not a third world country, and do you want to know why ? The venue that I have been working for the past 7 years has hanged backets  to hold the water the leaks profiously from the ceiling after a couple of hours of rain. It is an accident waiting to happen right here in the heart of your first world country.

It is a direct consequence of the irresponsibility that took place here in Brazil, where with a little amount of money you may have access to everything. Corruption causes those things. They neglected lives for money, to gain a little more and just now they are worried about something they always had to do.
They say the place had no permition to work since august, but last year it was the same way, even with permition, I mean, the permitions existed even with no safety conditions to that. Who permited this and based on what?
However, it is not time to find guilties, but to offer condolences and support those who directly lost friends and family there.
As brazilian, I sincerely hope that here will be not a better, but a more respectfull place.

The Jan/27th fire tragedy in Brazil: How long it will take until another young life is gone by negligence and greed of others? The emotion rolercoaster of these brazilian families whom so many precious and young lives were taken away on such unespeakable manner seems to be like the top of a huge, imense iceberg: the day after this tremendous loss will leave deep, heartbreaking and long lasting wounds and scars in parents, brothers, sisters, families, friends. As we ask God for mercy and light for those who are now transpassing the last frontier we also pray for the enlighted confort that only God may seed among those who stay. While we all mourn the event, it will be also the time to campaign and enforce whatever is necessary to avoid that this long chain of faults - of men, return in the manner of an announced tragedy again. Thank you all for your thoughts of faith and help.

Some people in the third world think that by criticizing their countries harshly in front of the first world, they are setting themselves apart from the masses. That it would make them look like the wise elite, "different" in the eyes of the world. As an American who knows many Brazilians, I've met those people: they criticize "Brazilians" harshly as if they were something else, something superior. It's a mechanism of defense.

You miss the point that ANY criticism is generally seen as a personal attack.  I.e. no distinction between destructive/pointless and constructive criticism.
.
If you're indeed American, you know that dissent, venting discontent and constructive criticism lie at the core of the democratic process.
.
Democracy also needs rule of law (and a number of other things, such as a high literacy rate) to function properly, and that's something severely flawed in Brazil.  You probably agree on that, too, unless you belong to one of the starry-eyed foreigners who fell prey to PT propaganda and will eventually lose their shirt here.
.
It's not superiority or anything like that - it is what it is, and the people you refer to are just fed up with the constant lying and posturing.  Give them the opportunity to vent their frustration - whether they could indeed do things differently is an entirely different story.  .
I agree with you that we could well see a repeat of the Argentinean scenario, where the entire government is ousted and replaced by a new government that's just as bad, or worse...

Lets put a little perspective on two very different economies of scale.
A Brazilian private university that houses 150 students calls the local fire dept (bombeiros) to notify of structural changes to their institution and to register for the necessary safety regulations. A bombeiro - a state employee - advises that before the necessary documents can be issued a "private company" has to inspect the premise and issue a report of findings.
The "private employee" visits and issues a list of to-dos a mile long with a costing out of all proportion.
On investigating this "private company" its established that the company is a shell for bombeiro -state worker corruption. And if you think this is an isolated case? Think again.
On the flip side and I address this to locals the likes of "Im Marian", remember that Brazil houses 2million people on the beach every year in Copacabana and 1 million visitors every Carnaval without a hitch.
My conclusion is that you Marian and all the other "locals' need to get off your lard arses and the blogs and start voting at ground political level for proper change.
I'm a gringo who resides here and the problem that I see is not at the top end champaign gala event i.e. Carnival, NYEve, World Cup Events..etc.
Its more about getting apathetic Brazilians to stop voting for the likes of Tiririca the clown and Romario the ex pop star footballer and to start to get serious about your country...PORRA!!

It is not a matter of anti Brazilians. It is a matter to talk about and demand a change. Arrest the singers ?! Is this some kind of joke? We are watching a clear lack of responsibility. It is not this country here or there but curiously why we do not hear such things happening in Canada or Germany or Finland or wherever? It is an horror in Brazil. We must reunite and demand changes. Security guards blocking securities, yes, yes. China and Russia reinforced the law regarding this issue. Rhode Island learned with what happened and are working on reducing risks. It is not the first time, just for the record. In 2001, in my town, we had a terrible accident exactly alike. http://www.hojeemdia.com.br/minas/incendio-lembra-caso-do-canec-o-mineir...
I have a friend, who had 80% of her body completely burned and she survived.
I just had a look at her process (penal) and guess what? She had nothing so far. Tomorrow the judge will publish the sentence. This lawsuit is on going since 2005. It took years (4)for her to finally sue the owners of the Night Club Canecao Mineiro.
So, 2005 and tomorrow a quite final decision. This is easy almost 8 years process on our judiciary system. In a few days I will let you all know the content. Don't we deserve a change???
Are we gonna be tolerant with this kind of situation ?
Could you help? Let's not forget... This is going to be a great help.

The band members and owners were arrested temporarily, because police found evidences that they were tampering with the investigations. Two band members are accused of hiding the evidences of having used illegal pyrotechnics, and only these two have been arrested. Computers that registered the number of people inside the night club, as well as footage taken by security cameras have also disappeared. 
Tampering with investigations can lead to temporary arrests in Brazil, as in most countries.
If we really want a change, the band must also be held responsible (if they are found guilty and after the due legal process), since their actions probably also contributed a great deal to this tragedy.

Well put: "We want more rights with fewer obligations", aka "Gerson's Law", which permeates Brazilian society.
Having said that, we should remember that in theory, Brazil works well, meaning there are very detailed and apparently well-meaning laws and regulations, but in practice they frequently don't 'catch on' or then there's a (corrupt) way around them.  The corrupt way is appealing, because the laws and regulations are often so convoluted that nobody really understands them so they become money-making opportunities for corrupt officials and the facilitating intermediaries.  This is important to remember when talking about the license, which was expired (but one had been granted to the venue at one point).  So, the license granted was one to a nightclub which could hold upwards of 1,000 guests, with only one entrance/exit...  That's what reeks of corruption, and similar situations exist in the thousands all over Brazil.
Just remember how Brazil is prepared to deal with disasters before coming to mass events here...

I am from the UK but have a company in Florianopolis, which is located in southern Brazil.
From my personal experience of the building that I lease, Fire Safety codes are not followed and generally people are disinterested. 
Our building has a fire escape but there is a metal bar with a padlock keeping it shut. When I asked the other tenants of the building if they'd like a key copy made (there are 4 other companies), they all refused to have one as nobody that I spoke to was willing to pay the R$20 (US$20) fee.
I'm sure that complacency played a big part, and also stupidity on the bouncers part for not allowing the clientele to leave the building until they settled their bills.

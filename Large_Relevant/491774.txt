@jbfane totally agree. going to either of those places is you asking for trouble. from people drunk to dudes being over protective of their women, its a recipe﻿ for disaster.

Anyone stupid enough to go out to a bar or nightclub is, well they﻿ are basically, just asking for something bad to happen to them. Avoid bars and nightclubs that should be obvious to even the most idiotic person.

Lack of preparation and a lack of regulation killed the 231. Fire codes are there for a reason and﻿ probably were applicable here but if no one enforces them it does no good.

0400: Three bombers leave Yorkshire



Mohammad Sidique Khan, 30, Shehzad Tanweer, 22, and 18-year-old Hasib Hussain leave West Yorkshire in a rented blue Nissan Micra bound for Luton. They were renting a flat in Alexandra Grove, Leeds, and had turned the property into a "bomb-making factory". Earlier preparation was carried out at a second address in Chapeltown Road.


0453: Bombers buy petrol



The three bombers are caught on CCTV at a service station at Woodall on the M1 buying petrol, Ginsters cheese and onion pasties, crisps and lemon-flavoured mineral water. Tanweer, the driver, fills up the vehicle and pays for the goods, while Hussain sits in the front seat and Khan in the back.


0505: Fourth bomber arrives at Luton



The fourth bomber, Germaine Lindsay, 19, who lived in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, arrives at Luton train station in Bedfordshire in a maroon Fiat Brava. A parking attendant later sees him asleep in the front seat. He exchanges phone calls and text messages with Khan.


0651: Men meet at station



Khan, Tanweer and Hussain arrive at Luton train station car park. They meet up with Lindsay and the four men are seen by witnesses opening the boots of their cars (circled above) and getting out rucksacks before heading towards the station building. Police later found nail bombs in the rented Nissan Micra.


0720: Four bombers head for trains



The four bombers, carrying their rucksacks full of explosives, leave Luton station car park to head for the trains and are caught on CCTV. Records suggest they passed through the barriers between 0722 and 0723 using three-day return tickets.


0724: Men catch train



The four men, still carrying their rucksacks, catch the delayed 0723 Bedford to Brighton train bound for London King's Cross Thameslink from platform one. They are seen on board the train by witness Ben Leech, who described them as smiling, laughing and generally looking relaxed.


0823: Bombers enter Underground



The bombers arrive at King's Cross Thameslink on the delayed train, which should have arrived at 0759. The four men walk together along the platform before heading down the stairs towards the Underground. 


0826: Bombers split up ahead of attacks



CCTV images at King's Cross station show the four men together for the last time. They are seen splitting up, each one apparently going towards a different section of the London Underground. Witness Joseph Martoccia described the men as acting like they were in a sports team and "in really good spirits" before they split up.


0838: Tanweer gets on Tube



Shehzad Tanweer, a sports science graduate, boards an eastbound Circle Line train. 


0842: Khan gets on Tube



Mohammad Sidique Khan, the plot ringleader, gets on a westbound Circle Line train.


0848: Lindsay gets on Tube



Germaine Lindsay, a former carpet-fitter, boards a westbound Piccadilly Line train.


0849: Three bombs explode on Underground



Tanweer sets off his bomb between Liverpool Street and Aldgate stations on the eastbound Circle Line, killing seven. Khan, on a westbound Circle Line train, detonates his rucksack between Edgware Road and Paddington, killing six. Lindsay, on a packed westbound Piccadilly Line train, sets off his bomb between King's Cross and Russell Square, killing 26. CCTV footage shows smoke billowing from the tunnel at Liverpool Street station.


0852: 'There's people on the track'



After a series of phone calls reporting a loss of power, London Underground receives the first reports of explosions at Liverpool Street and Edgware Road. A minute later the supervisor at Aldgate, Celia Harrison, tells the control room there are people on the track. She is told British Transport Police (BTP) will be informed.


0854: Hussain leaves King's Cross



As the tube network becomes paralysed, Hussain, the only bomber not to board a train, is seen leaving King's Cross station. He heads east before visiting a Boots shop, from which he then exits a moment or two later. He tries to contact each of his friends on a mobile phone. He gets no reply.


0859: 'We don't think it's terrorist'



London Underground continues to receive calls about a variety of incidents across the network. During the next 20 minutes there is a great deal of confusion about what is happening. There are reports of a train derailment and a person under a train at Edgware Road, a loud bang at Russell Square and an emergency at Aldgate. They say a blown power cable could be to blame and later that it is not thought to be terror related.


0900: Hussain buys battery



Hussain, who has apparently experienced problems with his bomb, buys a nine-volt battery from a WH Smith shop at King's Cross station where he is seen rummaging around in his rucksack. He is then caught on CCTV wandering along Euston Road before heading to McDonald's for eight minutes.


0913: Tube emergency declared



A "code amber" network emergency is declared by the Underground's control room instructing trains to go to the nearest, safe, available platform. A further instruction was sent at 0940 to begin evacuating an estimated 200,000 passengers from more than 500 trains.


0924: Last CCTV sighting of Hussain



Hussain is last seen by CCTV walking east towards Gray's Inn Road, near King's Cross. It is believed that he then took a number 91 bus westbound from Gray's Inn Road to Euston where he boarded a number 30 bus to Old Street.


0929: Police confirm 'major incident'



The Metropolitan Police confirm they are dealing with a major incident in London, but say it is too early to know what has happened. Until then, the official line had been that there had been "power surges" on the Underground.


0947: Hussain detonates his bomb on bus



Hussain triggers his device on a crowded number 30 double-decker bus in Tavistock Square, near King's Cross, killing 13 people. Video footage shows smoke emerging from the bus and people dashing from the scene. The vehicle comes to a standstill outside the British Medical Association and many of the victims are treated by doctors in the building's courtyard. 


1021: Police confirm 'multiple explosions'



Scotland Yard says there have been "multiple explosions" in London. Minutes later British Transport Police confirm there has been an explosion on a bus in Tavistock Square.


1053: Public transport suspended



In one of the first public statements by officials, Home Secretary Charles Clarke says "dreadful incidents" have caused "terrible injuries" and confirms London's public transport has been suspended. He says Prime Minister Tony Blair has been informed and advises the public in London not to make unnecessary journeys.


1055: Motorists told not to enter London



As officials begin to understand the scale of what has happened, central London is declared a no-go area and all services within zone one are suspended. Transport for London says extra safety checks are being undertaken on all other buses that remain in service. It also announces that the congestion charge has been suspended and advises drivers not to enter the centre of the capital.


1115: 'Confusing situation'



More than two hours after the first blasts, London's Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, tells a news conference he knows of "about six explosions" but it is "still a confusing situation". He advises Londoners to "stay where you are - all of London's transport is currently disabled". He refuses to confirm any fatalities.


1125: First deaths confirmed



The first reports confirming deaths in the blasts emerge. A police spokesman says there are at least two fatalities. The president of the European Parliament, Josep Borrell, goes on to blame terrorism for a "co-ordinated series of attacks".


1205: Blair speaks of 'series of attacks'



Prime Minister Tony Blair, breaking off from the G8 summit in Gleneagles, says there has been "a series of terrorist attacks in London". He confirms people have died and that some are seriously injured. "It is reasonably clear this is designed and timed to coincide with the opening of the G8", he says, adding that he will return to London within hours.


1210: Al-Qaeda claims responsibility



BBC Monitoring locates a website linked to al-Qaeda with a 200-word statement saying it carried out the bombings. "The heroic mujahideen have carried out a blessed raid in London," it says. The organisation calls itself the Secret Organisation Group of al-Qaeda of Jihad Organisation in Europe. The group was previously unknown.


1255: Four bombings confirmed



Home Secretary Charles Clarke tells the House of Commons that four explosions have been confirmed, three on trains and a fourth on a bus (shown above). "We do not know who or what organisations are responsible for these terrible criminal acts," he says. He confirms that the Underground will remain closed all day.


1325: Blair flies to London



UK Prime Minister Tony Blair leaves Gleneagles summit in a Chinook helicopter. Minutes later US President George W Bush, speaking at the Gleneagles summit, condemns the attacks, saying that the blasts show the war on terror must continue.


1500: Bus services resume



London's bus services are reinstated but the Underground remains closed. By 1700, most bus routes are up and running again, but Transport for London advises passengers to allow considerable extra time for their homeward journeys.


1525: Thirty-three confirmed dead



Police confirm that at least 33 people have been killed in the blasts. They say at least seven were killed in an explosion near Aldgate East station, another 21 died on a tube train in the Kings Cross/Russell Square area, and five were killed in a blast at Edgware Road. It is not yet known how many died on the bus in Tavistock Square, they say.


1530: Blair pledges justice



Prime Minister Tony Blair goes straight into a meeting of the government's emergency Cabinet Office Briefing Room A committee (Cobra) and later promises to bring those responsible to justice. He insists that in the face of these attacks, the British people remain resolute.


1531: Police 'keeping open mind'



Another news conference is held. Police confirm there have been four blasts. They later say they are "keeping an open mind as to who the perpetrators might be". However, in the days and weeks that followed, it is confirmed that a total of 52 people lost their lives that day, and that Mohammad Sidique Khan, Shehzad Tanweer, Germaine Lindsay and Hasib Hussain were responsible for the attacks.

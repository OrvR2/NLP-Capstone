People﻿ say that this is the punishment of God because brazilians have been corrupted by sex, alcohol and drugs.

I'm Brazilian, from Recife, northeastern coast. Last number I heard was over 245 dead people, beside more than 100 wounded. It's always sad when something﻿ like this happens, here or anywhere else, so many people who wanted to have some fun and now lost their lives or will need therapy for long years to get over it.

The problem is the goverment of Brazil is lax on building codes. The club don't even have emergency sprinkle system, fire extingisher and the lists goes on. I don't think this club have﻿ been inspected by a fire marshal yearly. There is not even a single undercover police investigator presence inside the club to make a report what is going on inside the club to find out if there is drugs and prostitution. Brazil goverment is very lax. And family crying for justice?

The owners of this club remind me of the profitOnly' Atitude of many owners here in the US. They spent lots of time, effort and money on those 2 huge outdoor signs that light up the night with the name of their club. Yet they did not make effort to open up a 2nd or 3rd exit? just weird and incredibly short sighted to have only 1 exit with LOTS of young people inside. Even more weird that so many of﻿ us have already read the stories about the similar mass death fires in US & Russia -also 1 exit

Having only one exit is just﻿ part of the problem. There are many other faults that altogether lead to such catastrophes. And even buildings with the most advanced prevention technologies and design, and fire retardants, would still not be 100% safe. But better safer than not.

This angers me how it happened and makes me sad that it happened all at the same time. The anger is the club owner let 3000 people into a club at the same time =Z and saddens that 250 lost their lives due to his greed!! =( People never go into a club 2000 people﻿ past capacity. this is only a disaster waiting to happen. Even if a fight breaks out, where could you run? Where could you go? It's too many people in one tight spot =( omg God bless the families please God bless them

EVERYONE involved in managing or operating﻿ this club should be jailed for LIFE. How could anyone with good conscious run a nightclub knowing it had no sprinkler system, no fire escapes and insufficient fire extinguishers.
Obviously club owners learned NOTHING from The Station fire, because this was Great White all over again. Deja vu indeed... R.I.P.

List of culprits ( my opinion)
1)Salvage capitalism: Every community should have designed﻿ public space for entertainment. Now must go to jail all that had personal profit with that tragedy;
2) Creationist religion: countries dominated by these religions has the efficient mind deviated by belief in protection of non-resent gods: Absurd that parents in Brasil stay at home praying asking god for keep safety their youngs that left home, instead going ahead and checking where they are going.(Cont.)

3) The doctrine of mass-conditioning and control exerted by Brazilian economic elite﻿ by 500 hundred years: the result is the most individualist society I have seen.
4) The lack of education by parents and schools about rules for societies: in Brasil it produces a personal corrupted character which is projected at society level. Results: Public employees doesn't take responsibilities, politicians targets personal profit, everybody trying to take advantages from public patrimony.
And so on...

Greedy club owners.. fire exit isn't supposed to be unlockable from the inside. They did this on purposes to prevent﻿ people from running away from the bill.. running clubs like this shouldn't be possible, the government in this country isn't doing their job. Payment up front should be the only option in establishments like this when you are in countries that have this bad security supervision..

These young, dumb, and full of﻿ ... brazilians think it's cool to let their guard down and pack a nightclub of 1000 capacity persons with 2000 people. Then one of these jokers gets the bright idea of lighting pyrotechniques inside this masterpiece of disaster and they all﻿ act surprised when in the panic, 245 people die burning and screaming and getting trampled by the same people they were dancing and fucking just minutes ago. Darwinism at it's finest. Maybe now they'll use common sense.

It's sad what happened but I'm just wondering if this had happened in a favela (poor mostly black people) funk club if most brazilians would care. It's funny when I hear brazilians cry racism when their﻿ country is full of racism towards the darker people when the so called white brazilian is not really white. I wonder if this would still be a national tragedy if it had happened in a favela...hmmm

Why are you getting angry at some stupid people online... and then attacking an entire white race for what some idiots online say. You sound no better than they. I love latin America. I've met some really nasty Mexicans who would run their mouths﻿ and say some really horrible things towards others, but I always looked at those few as individuals. I think the Latin people are beautiful, and their nations amazing, but there will always be some assholes in every country. Regardless of race, origin..

But look in the USA in Rhode Island with all strict FIRE CODE regulations 100 died in similar situation, pirotecnics started fire, like here the band survived

and add to the fact that the private guards did not let anyone go outside. everybody was thinking: "fuck the bar bills,i'm out of here",but they draw the guns and said: "no pay,no go"...
and in the mess, people looking for an﻿ emergency exit ended up in the Nightclub's Bathroom in a Horrific situation, there was so many people trying to enter that was impossible to get out... i heard from a officer that when they got inside that bathroom there are dozens of bodies there...

I got more information from a survivor, seems like the band started the fire it was small, they pour water from bottle on it then got fire extinguisher but did not work or guy didn't know how to use it , then the leader of the band told guys to sneak out of the club, while everybody was unaware of the fire, by the time they got to the front exit there was no light , no signs of EXIT, black tick smoke and by then nobody could breath, so took about 3 minutes in that condition to kill all﻿ 235

acording tho the Corpo de Bombeiros (Our Fire Dept.) Fireworks are allowed if the place have the necessary infrastructure here in brazil, the problem was(according to them),that the Kiss nightclub had Zero infrastructure to such a thing,so this was a disaster waiting to happen.
and yes, i do think is an insanity ignite a flare indoors,especially in a nightclub like that.but no matter what those things will﻿ continue to happen,unfortunately...-_-

Oh so now it's appropriate to talk shit about a country going through hard times? I don't remember seeing any brazilian talking shit when the wtc went down,﻿ or when those children died in Newtown. You can have any response you want, but I just don't think it's fair to those who are suffering, and those who actually care.

So everyone whose opinions you disagree with aren't entitled to posting them? Seems you aren't tolerant of freedom of speech. More people die everyday to the flu than the number of dummies who died in the nightclub﻿ fire.

brazil is a beautiful country, im saddened for the loss of life. my sister in law is from lima peru, and had friends that died in this fire. if some people were gay that died its still a tragedy, a human life is still a precious life regardless of race,gender,orientation. I feel terribile for all the people affected by this trajedy. any building should have a sprinkler fire suppression system, ﻿ needs to be worldwide law.

No, they're jealous that Brazilian men actually look good, while they look fat greasy crusty. No one wants to see someone with the body of McDonald's shirtless covered in acne bumps from grease breakouts. Plus, people who are making saying foul things about these people anything can happen anywhere at anytime, do not ever think something can't﻿ happen to you. If less people thought that way, sh!t like this would happen way less in the world.

It depends. In certain clubs, you stay if you merely buy a drink. There is no cover charge or entrance fee. Popular clubs can do the cover charge thing or if there is a main event, like a live band, they might charge a cover, but it depends how good the club is and if they want to charge customers for their popularity as a club or﻿ the entertainment inside.

No. From what I recall most people die in fires not from the fires themselves but from the smoke inhalation kills them first. So, my guess is combine that with crowded room, limited exists and panic, and the inability to see where you need to go to escape and it's sheer chaos, worse than a sinking ship since most of the people wouldn't even know which direction to go once the place fills with smoke.﻿

There is no such thing as karma as some intelligent force. Sure, people who do bad things, make enemies and thus increase their likelihood of something bad being done to them in return, but there is﻿ no guarantee of that.

This is the first time I've heard of this. It's odd that you would make the comment "gay rights people making [too] many demands" and yet have a "rainbow thumbnail". I hope you didn't make this implicit﻿ comment, "mass extermination of gays" out of your supposed minority-view bias - that would be a very unconscionable thing to do.

A big nightclub﻿ with manny people is a death trap ones fire breaks out. Its a good habbit if you check when you are in a club where the emergency exits are. So you know before when panic breaks out, there is smoke﻿ and fire in what way you should guide your loved ones.

Same happend in the Netherlands also a few years back. Its because there are to less emergency exits for the people who are in the club. When panic breaks out people cant get out and even walk over people that fell on the ground to get out first. Nightclubs only think off money and they make lots of﻿ money. But are to cheap to get their safety measure in good status.

It was over capacity with 2000 instead of 1000 and the fire exits were locked﻿ and blocked by bouncers. 200 casualties was an avoidable loss.

Most night clubs, in third World countries, are dead traps.﻿ Locked exits, lacking fire alarms, inadequate premises, over crowded space.

very, very sad, i have many really amazing brazilian friends, such warm and lovely people. the club should not have had three times the capacity in there, there should have been no "flares" to burn the ceiling down and more emergency exits. ﻿ apparently the smoke was so dense, many perished looking for the exit and mistaking the restroom for the way out :( poor parents....

The first 30 seconds, 1 minute, yes... they didn't see what happened, they didn't know something wrong was happening, because the place was huge, so the entrance was a bit far away from the epicenter.
But the main problem, so far, was an idiot and irresponsible pyrotechnic concert INSIDE a﻿ place so warm and overcrowded.
I'm really sad, because they were so young and brilliant people (the most part were students from UFSM,a university really hard to entry in Brazil).

My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims, their families and loved ones. Unfortunately we, society as a whole, learn the hard way. It wasn't enough﻿ to hear about other nightclub fires like The Station Nightclub (The Great White-tragedy) in Rhode Island in 2002/2003? Or at Lame Horse nightclub in Russia/2009. Or in China and Argentina. It doesn't matter what part of the world. It happened and it can happen again. I hope we'll learn it this time around and honor all the lives lost.

All you know or have seen are stupid images filmed and edited by silly foreigners who like to perpetuate the stereotype that you have in mind.﻿ Just like they do in India, Middle East, etc). That's so acurate as a Brazilian thinking that all Americans are stupid fat redneck pigs! When in fact, only 50% are!

If i am not wrong .... during the initial stage of the fire, i bet many party goes thought it was part of the act or some kind of stunt shows ( stunt﻿ shows always happened in such places). But when the fire started to rage uncontrollable only then these people started to panic .... and the rest is history.
correct me if i am wrong.

Brazil should really look﻿ into fire safety regulations. One good example is when you rent an apartment, you get a key that you use to operate the lock from inside and outside. That is one big fire hazard. Imagine a fire starts and you need to find that key to open the door, what if you can't find the key.......

Why feel bad at all? It ain't like you knew any of them. If it weren't for the news media we'd have never even known they existed. But now, thanks to your friendly neighborhood RT, we've gotta listen to a bunch of would-be saints crying fake tears over a bunch of idiot kids who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Same as it ever was!﻿

There's something about human beings that you're not familiar: the capability of sympathizing and even empathising with other people's sufferance.
If you don't feel anything I don't see why you should even leae a comment.
Why don't you watch another video?
Just remember what you wrote when a tragic event happens to you or a member of your family.
People you don't even now will be at your side.

I cannot believe how sick religious people can be. Arguing about their delusional beliefs on a yt video about the horrific deaths﻿ of 200 people in a fire. It is not the culture of people dancing and taking drink and drugs that is sick. It is you sick,pig ignorant religious cunts that are the sickness in this world. Go find another video to spread your vile shit on. Fucking cunts!

I don't see the use of flaming on people who share their religious beliefs, okay, so they mock and treat the death of 200 as a joke, just ignore it. No need to start telling everyone that is religious is a cunt. I honestly﻿ have lost faith in humanity when you said that. Is it not the twentieth century?

The band vocalist caused that by by lighting a sputnik which launched flames﻿ on the foam-covered ceiling which then caught fire and soon after the toxic fumes took over the place in a short time which was the cause for over 90% of death toll in the nightclub.

It was a graduation party, there were teenagers, mothers, fathers and even some elders. What caused the fire was lack of worry and maintenance from the club's owner and the brazilian government. It was a place that could only have up to 1.3 thousand people, but in fact there were over 2 thousand. For that many people the emergency exit should have been 22 feet tall, but in fact it was only 6 feet tall. A fire lit from a malfunctioning equipment caused the fire. And people just couldn't escape.﻿

Excuse me but it is the club owners resonsibility to make sure the﻿ building does not combust. Also their policy of allowing a tab added to the deaths. The door staff(Meathead bouncers)would not allow anyone past who had not paid their tab. Free will says we choose how we live our lives not you or any body else. Do you drink tea or coffee?

He's right you﻿ know, you are a sick, evil cunt.
You have no compassion for fellow human beings and actually appear to take pleasure in their deaths because they dont live and believe in the same way as you?
I find your attempt to assert your moral superiority, as morally repugnant and a grotesque example of religious thinking which is sadly all too common.
In short, you are the devil.

I'm also Brazilian Enki.
Funny because I was in a discussion room at PalTalk three months ago.
It was a white supremacist group and there was a Finish man who was doing a hate speech.
He was so angry because black people immigrated to Finland that he said:
"I don't know. I'm on the verge of losing my mind." "I'll end up killing some of them,"
There were people from other nations at the room.
What culture is this guy referring to?
I think he doesn't even know what the term﻿ "culture" implies.

It is due above all to bourgeois politicians not having the foggiest idea about things, when in so many countries people act﻿ as though they believed that the Jewish-plutocratic west would defeat the Jewish-Bolshevik east. On the contrary, the Jewish-Bolshevik east will one day relieve Jewry in the west of necessity of continuing to be hypocritical. With complete candor, it can then announce its actual objectives. The Jewish democracy of the west will eventually lead to Bolshevism.

Aren't we all sons of daughters﻿ of this same God of pray for?Being saddistic and happy for the suffering of youths only displays the fact that you must be a sociopath. Respect our pain.We have nothing to do with your war and you know nothing about us Brazilians.Go to hell

Well, your somewhat right I think. But people who care only for vanity materialism and self indulgence don't necessarily﻿ win Gods favor simply for existing﻿. Do you believe many there were practicing any faith much less leading a spiritual lifestyle? I don't want to come off as judgmental, but most Nightclubs cater to that mindset? I'm not saying they deserved it or they were evil but I think it does make one consider maybe there's more to our existence than short term gratification every week.

Indeed. Confused Monkey Planet.
People do not live like animals. If they did, they be much better off. Please, you﻿ shouldn't put down animals like that. They don't do the insanity that humans do. ;)
But, here's the rub. We, who have been blessed with sight, must LOVE them. If you don't, you are no better than the people you judge.

U could be a troll, but still this is Islam, Mohammad created Islam in his head overnight, its entirely fiction, it doesn't end there though, Mohammad was a pedophile and a pig and used Islam to justify marriage with 9 yr﻿ old girls.

Taliban was created by the USA... it has NOTHING to do with the tenents of Islam.. nothing. In fact it is diametrically opposite to what is taught. 'Jihad' and all that BS is a creation of USA spooks.. do some research... get educated... the REAL .0001% could not care less what happens to you, or anyone else...

The lead singer of the band playing at that moment lit a flare in the scenario that opened a lot of fireworks. The explosions hit the roof and quickly igniting soundproofing material. From that moment, the flames began to spread and highly toxic smoke caused widespread panic on the premises. Security prevented the departure of the people thinking they were going to leave without paying and it﻿ turns out that disco was not licensed to operate.
It's the fault of these victims? You're sick!

They probably all were microchipped with the mark of the beast. We know what happens to people after they die after taking the mark. It's a sad day for the world. 245 lost souls.﻿

Police officers who were traumatized by the horrific scene at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., last month and are now running out of paid sick and vacation time may soon get some financial help from an unlikely source: a yoga studio.
Linda Antignani, founder of Mother's Embrace Yoga in nearby Shelton, Conn., contacted the Newtown Police Department to ask what she could do to help after hearing about officers who have been unable to work in the wake of the Dec. 14 massacre, when a gunman opened fire, killing 20 children and six adults. The result: She has just launched an Adopt a Cop fund benefiting the traumatized officers.
According to the union representing the police, those suffering from post-traumatic stress are not entitled to workers' compensation benefits under the current town statute and have been forced to use sick and vacation time.
"The insurer for the town has taken a position that these officers are entitled to only what the statute allows," Eric Brown, an attorney for Council 15 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said last week. "Unfortunately for these officers, the statute doesn't allow any benefits." According to Brown, about 15 police officers have been unable to work due to trauma.
[Related: Scenes from Newtown, Connecticut]
Brown is hoping state lawmakers will push to change the statute for those who responded to the Newtown shootings when the 2013 legislative session begins on Jan. 9.
Until then, a liaison for the Newtown Police Department told Antignani that money raised through her yoga studio's Adopt a Cop fund could be converted into Walmart gift cards, so that the officers and their families can purchase food and other items while they remain out of work.
"Walmart was suggested by the liaison as the place where most Newtown officers would shop," Antignani explained. She's raised more than $180 so far.
"I don't know how much is needed," Antignani added. "Anything I can get together with the generous help of my students, friends and family is a good start."
Local police departments have been pitching in, too. On Christmas Day, officers from neighboring towns, including Shelton, offered to work in Newtown so officers there could spend the holiday with their families.

There is no training for seeing 20 dead children.  I hope these guys/girls get help fast.

Police officers are people just like you or me.  Just because they have to deal with #$%$ all the time doesn't mean they can handle the sight of 20 bloody 6-yr-olds.  How would you handle it??

It is always nice when someone does something nice for others with no expectation of anything in return. Bless those who do such things and God be with those who are the most in need.

Stress avoidance  training is available in most jurisdictions and most urban departments have health care professionals who help officers needing counseling. 

Nothing in life can prepare you for a classroom of dead 5-6 year old kids who suffered multiple horrific gun shot wounds. First responders had to check each body for signs of life which means you put your hands on their bodies, flip them over if they're on their stomach, check for breathing and go to the next body. That's a tough thing to do and even tougher to get out of your head.

I once knew a veteran CSI officer who was called to process a house for any weapons, as well as other evidence, used by a serial murder suspect. A young mother's body was found at one of the homicide scenes, however, her 6-8 month old baby's body was missing. The CSI officer found the baby's body in a shoe box under the murderer's bed. The baby's blood had been drained from its body by the murderer. The CSI officer retired shortly after processing the scene. Nothing in  life can prepare anybody for an event like that.

My son was one of the police officers from Ct that volunteered to work the Sunday
after Christmas so that these deserving police officers could take some time off.
The towns and cities have been generous concerning allowing their police officers
to help out.  Apparently and not unexpectedly this needs to be continued for a much
longer time.  Sometimes insurance companies need or should change their rules
to accommodate human needs.  If these poor police officers need help and time off
then for heaven's sake get it for them. I doubt that this woman's program is close to
what is needed.  A nice gesture however.

I  wouldn't want to be an Officer for a Million Dollars, most of these guys really start out with the desire to help people.  To maintain that desire is probably the biggest strain anyone could ever face.

Wow.......I wish we treated our veterans like this when they came back from the ravages of war!   Let's pair a cop with a returning Military Veteran.....Maybe the Veteran can get a little lucky and get some sympathy!

I'm not trying to be unreasonable with my response....but I think there's a few thousand veterans that need the same love, respect and support as these well to do cops do in this affluent suburb!!!!

Let's see how many signs and ink it would take to write down the number of lives conceal carry people save a year. Gun free zones and horrible parenting are the real problem. Millions of homes across america are not gun free zones, the only trajedies in those homes are caused by people. Guns dont fire by themselves, it happens from negligence or willingness to kill. Both of those are human problems!!

If you dont pay your property tax on your home they take it right? What if you had a tax on each gun you have registered that may be 200-2000$.. could get pricey and with a national data base, they could remove said property from you

Not a shotgun, not an ar15.. but could be a saiga ak in .223.. cant remember model number, might start with iz?!?! something. There's your .223 round

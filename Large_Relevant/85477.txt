Here at HuffPost Style, we never get sick of a good Photoshop fail -- hey, if we don't remind you that these touched-up portrayals are actually impossible to achieve, then who will? So we're happy to present you with the latest snap to raise our eyebrows: Jessica Alba on the cover of InStyle.
The actress is featured on the mag's February 2013 issue looking a little... off. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what the retoucher was trying to do, but her body looks strangely contorted. For starters, why is her hand so flat and wavy? It kind of looks like it's melting...
As for her waist and hips, it looks as if they've been shrunken and hollowed out. Like we said, we can't say with 100 percent certainty that these tweaks were made, but it's safe to say that InStyle definitely didn't leave the picture as is. They are past Photoshop fail offenders, after all.
So what's your call: too much Photoshop or just normal glossy retouching?




Quick Poll
Jessica Alba's InStyle cover is...





a Photoshop mess!





a normal retouched cover!

Oh, AnnNot only did <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/04/ann-taylor-website-glitch_n_670030.html" target="_hplink">Ann Taylor</a> take a few inches off of a model's waist, the brand's website accidentally revealed the "before" shot, thanks to a tech glitch. The "before" is on the left, and Ann's "improved" version is on the right.Tattoo Be Gone<em>Grazia</em> airbrushed one of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/11/megan-fox-tattoo-airbrush_n_1417917.html" target="_hplink">Megan Fox's tattoos</a> off her April cover. The tattoo that vanished? The Friedrich Nietzsche quote: "And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music." 

(Courtesy photo)And Your Little Dog, Too!We know Ralph likes to retouch his models, but <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/29/ralph-lauren-dog-photosho_n_629538.html" target="_hplink">can't</a> he leave the animals alone? We're guessing that's an entirely new head on the dog wearing a Polo and that he was just dropped into the image on the right.Misplaced ThumbsIn this jarring<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/18/ann-taylor-loft-photoshop-fail_n_1527096.html" target="_hplink"> Ann Taylor LOFT photo </a>of Linen Twill Shorts, the model appears to have a thumb emerge directly out of her arm, above the wrist.

(LOFT photo)The Magical Shrinking HeadNatalia Vodianova's July 2012 cover for <em>GQ Russia</em> has the model all out of proportion... and her hair seemingly carved out with the "lasso" tool on Photoshop.Glamour Chops Off Kristen's ArmWhen Kristen Stewart (awkwardly) posed on the cover of Glamour's November issue, she too fell victim to the photoshop madness. The potentially cute photo is ruined by a strange choice to cut off half of her arm (which somehow disappears into her leg).Pink Haze<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/15/jessica-alba-photoshop-marie-claire_n_1518929.html" target="_hplink">Jessica Alba is the latest victim of over-enthused retouching,</a> on the June 2012 cover of <em>Marie Claire.</em> The whole cover seems washed in a bright pink haze, and something seems a little robot-y about it to us. Maybe it's the way they did her hair?

(Courtesy photo)Look Ma, No Legs!<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/27/luciano-conti-professional-photoshop_n_1382739.html" target="_hplink">In this printed ad from an Italian haircare line</a>,  the female model's legs seem to have gone missing... or perhaps the male model's biceps are so big they conceal them?

(PSD photo)Angela's Swan NeckModel Angela Linvdall posed for the March cover of Vogue Mexico looking every beauty but also, very elongated. Her neck and jawline seemed to have been smoothed and stretched out or she's a modern-day Stretch Armstrong. Bloomie's Mutant Elbow<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/30/bloomingdales-retouch-photoshop-model_n_699015.html" target="_hplink">Bloomingdales</a> turned a perfectly innocent model into a mutant, giving her the pointiest, most elongated elbow we've ever seen.Out On A LimbThe leg bone is not connected to the hip bone. Period. And for more, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/08/victorias-secret-photosho_n_603661.html#s97486" target="_hplink">check out</a> a dozen or so airbrushed Angel fails.
Healthy...erBy now, we're used to seeing models' bodies whittled down -- but how about reverse retouching? Like, making someone appear heavier than she is? <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/17/kamilla-wladyka-airbrushe_n_579030.html" target="_hplink">That's</a> what happened with Kamilla Wladyka who was Photoshopped to look healthier. For the cover of <em>Healthy</em> magazine.On And OnAnd On And On. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/28/suaves-mango-mandarin-photoshop-retouched_n_741493.html" target="_hplink">This</a> model loves Suave's Mango Mandarin body wash so much that she hasn't realized she's an amputee.Something's Still Not Right...We don't think the lady model's legs make any sense in Dolce & Gabbana's ad for light blue, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/07/dolce-gabbanas-photoshop-_n_793208.html" target="_hplink">although</a>, somehow, 47 percent of you thought everything looked just peachy.Will's New 'Do<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/16/prince-william-brunette-o_n_464426.html" target="_hplink">We still</a> don't know what this was about but it seems more relevant than ever. Did Wills dye his hair just for the <em>Hello</em> cover shoot? Or was someone playing around with the color and contrast in everyone's favorite retouching program?Looking For A LawsuitHere's an interesting spin: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/24/irina-shayk-nude-sues-gq-spain_n_788213.html" target="_hplink">model</a> Irina Shayk claims <em>GQ</em> Spain Photoshopped the underwear right off of her and that she never posed in the buff. She's taking the Spanish glossy to court over the pics.Getting Steamy"New Zealand's Next Top Model" came <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/25/new-zealand-top-model-michaela-steenkamp-topless-photo_n_693714.html" target="_hplink">under fire</a> for having a 16-year-old contestant pose topless, with only mud smeared across her naked breasts and then posted an unedited picture from the shoot online. The solution? A spray of Photoshopped steam covering up the girl's chest.Anne Hathaway's ArmpitWhile Anne Hathaway looked stunning on British GQ's February 2010 issue, something's not quite right with her ultra-smooth armpit...Missing Arm, Thanks Ann TaylorAnother Ann Taylor photoshop fail...this time, they took out their airbrushing anger by amputating this poor model's arm!Model Or Barbie?On the January issue of ELLE Czech, model Denisa Dvorakova's arms channeled Barbie's freakishly sharp angled limbs. Furthermore, the synthetic looking visage of her face doesn't adds to her plastic-doll appearance. Hilary Rhoda's Angular Cheekbones We're not sure why someone would change Hilary Rhoda's already perfect and sky-high cheekbones to begin with-- but that didn't stop <em>Numero </em>Tokyo from engaging in this photoshop fail. The model's razor-sharp cheekbones were given a little <em>too</em> much tapering...yikes!The Duchess' Shockingly Tiny WaistSome were shocked at Kate Middleton's frail frame in her Alexander McQueen gown on her wedding day. But a <em>Grazia </em>magazine retoucher decided to take it up a notch by airbrushing her already tiny waist, to look just like a life-size Barbie's instead. It seems that<em> Grazia </em>has tried to trick us into thinking the Duchess has the worlds smallest waist.Christy Turlington Falls VictimIt's hard to even tell that this Maybelline ad features the one-and-only Christy Turlington, who is <em>so</em> airbrushed that she's basically unrecognizable. While the supermodel has always been known for her flawless complexion, her skin is <em>so </em>overly retouched that it bares more resemblance to a 3D animation than Christy herself.

<strong><em>CORRECTION:</em></strong> A previous version of this caption identified the makeup brand incorrectly.Louis Vuitton's Magic MirrorLouis Vuitton's fall 2010 campaign featuring models Christy Turlington, Karen Elson and Natalia Vodianova is so aesthetically pleasing to look at, that it's hard to notice this photoshop mystery. But if you look closely in the mirror, you'll see a random reflexion in the mirror that doesn't match up with the actual scene going on. Lila Grace Is Missing A FingerKate Moss and her eight-year-old-daughter Lila Grace are as pretty as can be in this September 2011 <em>Vogue </em>spread. But unfortunately, Lila Grace and her poor fingers are the victims in this photoshop disaster. Kim Kardashian's KurvesKim Kardashian has always embraced her curvy figure--but the original and untouched photo that Complex.com accidentally posted of a thinner Kim says otherwise.H&M's Disappearing ActThis photoshop faux-pass is brought to you by H&M, who decided to give this model a face lift...but literally. We're not quite sure why they choose to make her entire face disappear from a 45 degree view, but whatever the reason, it seriously freaks us out. Charlize's ClawPhotoshop was used and abused on the cover of Charlize Theron's <em>Los Angeles Confidential </em>cover. Her hand looks more like a paw (or claw) as it appears that her fingers have all melted together-- creepy!Walmart's Coloring Book We're pretty sure that a child was responsible for scribbling up (and coloring in) this photoshop fail. The sketchy image from Walmart appears to be selling a bikini top...but we can't really tell.Campari Thins Out JessicaThis Campari campaign morphed Jessica Alba into a much (much) thinner version of herself. While she looks perfectly fit in both images, if the originals hadn't been leaked, we probably would have actually believed the lies...But unfortunately this wasn't the case.Another Ann Taylor BlunderWhile this isn't exactly the worst (or most obvious) photoshop flub we've seen, the original footage from this Ann Taylor campaign tells a different story. The screenshot, taken from a "behind-the-scenes" video, is a much more accurate portrayal of Naomi Watts- who looks way too overly airbrushed in the final version.Scary SkinnySomeone messed up big time with this unrealistically photoshopped waist on Nordstrom's website. We're so distracted by her startlingly small torso that we can't even focus on the cute orange polo shirt.

<em>Note: This caption was edited for clarity's sake.</em>Paris' Plastic CoverIs it just us, or does Paris Hilton looks faker than ever on this Vanity Fair cover? Her strangely smooth face actually sort of creeps us out to be honest.Talbot's One-Legged ModelDoes anyone else feel bad for this victim of retouching madness? This Talbot's photoshop abuser settled on giving this poor model only one leg.Lancome's Wrinkle-Free AdFor being 44 years old, Julia Roberts looks pretty near amazing. And while the actress still looks pretty in this Lancome ad, we just wish they didn't make her skin look <em>so</em> freakishly smooth. From the looks of it, the retouchers airbrushed the life out of Julia Roberts' face, and gave her a plastic visage instead.Something's Off About This...Victoria's Secret, who is a notorious fan of photoshop abuse, was up to their old tricks again. This time, Model Candice Swanepoel's shoulder joint appears to be disconnected from the rest of her body.Marissa's Amputated ArmUm, should someone tell Marissa Miller that she's missing a limb? Evidently, Victoria's Secret took out a fit of retouching rage on the model's arm. Zooey's Creepy LookalikeJust wondering, but who is that girl in those recent Rimmel ads? The faulty campaign featured a photoshopped image of someone who resembled a Zooey Deschanel lookalike with plastic surgery gone wrong.Khloe's Shrinking HeightLast time we checked, Khloe Kardashian is noticeably taller than both Kim and Kourtney...Khloe, who at 5'10 normally towers over her pint-sized sisters, apparently shrunk down to "fit" the frame for this Sears campaign shot by Annie Leibovitz. And what's going on with Khloe's right hand?A Lapse In Judgement From Ralph Lauren It's pretty disturbing that these Ralph Lauren photos somehow got the go-ahead to be published in the first place...The fashion label received harsh criticism for these images featuring an emaciated looking model, who actually more so resembles a bobble head on a skeletal frame. Even more alarming is that the photoshop victim, Filippa Hamilton- claims that she was actually fired by Ralph Lauren for being "too fat."  Model's Talon <a href="http://www.simplybe.co.uk/shop/" target="_hplink">SimpleBe</a>, a UK brand known for catering to plus sizes, has photoshopped this models hand into, what appears to be, a claw. Extra HandThis <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/19/target-photoshop-fail-sale-ad_n_1438157.html" target="_hplink">Target Australia </a>ad contains one major mistake: there seems to be a hand resting on mom's hair. Yeah, that's an extra limb, that we assume belongs to the dad.

				Jessica Alba has always been my fantasy celebrity lady since I’ve first seen her on “Dark Angel”.  Why anyone would photo shop her is beyond comprehension.  She’s naturally beautiful inside and out.

				I don't know about inside, neither do you, but otherwise, I agree (not that you asked for it) with you completely. I've always thought she was very hot. No need to retouch anything. A nice fantasy indeed. Pretty much looks like what she's used to rocking to me........

				Oh my goodness you people! The stats are in and Ironicaly the same as the election numbers. Romney (Huff-and-I'Il-Puffpo=47%) an Obama (Normal=52%) This is a normal retouched cover. Not a Photoshop fail any criteria. A Photoshop Fail is an Elephant made to balance on a beachball, –a failure of imagination. Do you tell your can opener in the drawer it is a failed instrument when you are hungry for tuna? Get a clue and a real job. Covers such as these are 1) meant for teenaged girls and 2) to be viewed for a maximum of 15 seconds. The cover text trumps the image in an instant while friendly Kirk asks you for your Safeway card. Surely the time and effort into making them perfect is mind-boggling. There are large committees presiding over their creation and execution including ad research people and mind-numbing scientific readability studies. Not to mention the multiple thousands of dollars on the creative side. Congratulations for taking just about as much time wringing your hands over this image and it's what, Photoshop Moralism? Please give me a fork to stab my eye! 

I think Jessica is pretty, and her hands are beautiful. I find Glamour tedious and 2 dimensional. I am the decider. 15 seconds folks. Thank god the voting public is not stupid.

				looks like photoshop failure to me unless Ms. Alba has a cavern for an arm pit located next to her back and has had the contour of the flesh on her back surgically removed .. that definitely does not look real ... and why taint the natural beauty of someone like Ms. Alba .... this isn't about who's beautiful and who's not ... this is about deceit ...

				photo shopped it is .. unless Ms. Alba has quite the cavern as an arm pit ... and also has had flesh shaved from the contour of her back ... that part doesn't come close to looking normal and why can't it be left normal - she's a beautiful young woman so why taint anything ... and folks wonder why women get up in arms .... IMHO it's not about who's perfect or who can be photoshopped the quickest after having a baby ... it's about friggin' deceit

				Nothing to see here.  I'm sure her skin was touched up and some smoothing out of wrinkles in the clothes etc. but it is completely possible to look like this in the body area.  Her hand is utterly normal looking.  You need to get out more and see a variety of body sizes and shapes.  Some women are very very thin and I mean MUCH thinner than Jessica appears in this photo and they aren't dropping down with hunger either.

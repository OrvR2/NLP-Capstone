We all knew it wouldn't be long before dems paraded this freak out in public to sell their anti gun message. Just because this woman was too dumb to have﻿ armed security at her political rally does not mean my gun rights should be taken. Fuck you Gabby!

What gives this ex-political the right to speak. I have two bullet holes in me but I don't remember anyone calling me to speak. It just makes me sick that if you are shoot in a mass shooting or you are some﻿ rich whatever you﻿ are somehow elevated to spokesperson for the anti-gun crowd whereas if you are not anti-gun in the same instance you will not be given any airtime. Just look at who gets to speak and you will see that I'm right. This country is bullshit and it's only getting worse.

its sickening how they use this woman as a puppet. how they always use the excuse of "for the children" to strip us of our only means to protect ourselves from a government this wishes to enforce﻿ complete control over its citizens and make them subjects to the crown of congress. They are coming for all our guns, not just the semi autos. they will have every weapon, right down to the bolt action 22. This is the excused they have been waiting for.

what do you mean by 'only means to protect ourselves from the government'? this country's constitution is based on﻿ popular sovereignty, and our rights are preserved by the bill of rights. you're justifying KILLING PEOPLE or what? anyways, you have the republican majority in the house to represent you. by the way, you're being extremely paranoid.

Hungry is bad. Food is good. No paycheck is bad. Paid bill is good. Life is great. Death sucks.... So, why this woman had to testify on the obvious. And did those jerks﻿ absolutely had to select a disabled person to do that?? Very much like those white robs on journalists during the Obama care speech. Stupid and pathetic.

To the guy with the Cuba comment. If we go to Cuba it is for better air quality, free education, some of the best inexpensive health care in the world, truly organic food, and a much less stressful lifestyle. You can stay in the USA with your guns﻿ and stress. Most of the country, the majority by far and perhaps as high as 80% are in favor of gun control so maybe is the other 20% who should go to Pakistan they like guns there too.

That's all that modern liberals think about anymore....
Want to raise taxes? - Show pictures of poor people
Want to increase "global warming" funding? - Show a picture of a drowning polar bear
Want﻿ more gun control? - Let a shooting victim speak
Liberals do not care that violent crime skyrockets where gun laws are more strict or that the earths temp has actually dropped since 1997 or that taxes have never been higher.... it's all about emotion.

how many of these commitee members own the exact same guns they are deliberating about? Truthfully. how many belong to a gun club? how many live in protected developments with iron gates and walls, surveillance cameras and security systems and still purchase the higher powered weapons themselves? and really who cares? its their right! guns arent going﻿ anywhere people. if anything guns are the only means of keeping order in an increasingly suffering society. due to GOV. sanctioned pillaging.

@RomansGalatians typical guy: stereotyping anyone against his views and calling women illogical. I'm sorry I didn't share my whole life story and political views with you on this Mensa meeting place. I don't care what you think.﻿ You don't care what I think. You are using your insecurity to fuel your irrational anger at a stranger.

the problem is not guns. the problem are people that are sick and need mental health﻿ help. we need to have a better mental health safety net. if guns are banned people will use bow and arrows, ban bows people will use knives. ban knives people use their bare hands. banning weapons, does not get to the root of the real problem, mental health.
to stop the violence we need to start building more mental institutions.

As a result of her gunshot wound to the head, Ms. Giffords has a﻿ speech disorder called aphasia, most likely Broca's. Her mind functions perfectly well, but she has difficulty﻿ articulating speech and expressing herself verbally. With the aid of speech therapy, she is able to produce speech to the extent that she does. Though her statement is brief and consists of short words and short sentences, it is not an indication of her intelligence. It is only what she can physically do at the moment.

an assault rifle ban will do nothing to stop another mass shooting from happening nor will it lower the murder rate. not all mass shootings happen with assault rifles but all mass shootings are committed by crazy people in gun free zones. 8585 people were murdered in 2011 (fbi) 323 of these by rifles, not just assault rifles, all types of rifles.
in my opinion if you want to prevent another mass shooting from happening end gun free﻿ zones. And to drop the murder rate, end the drug war.

It is a horrible thing that happened to Gabrielle Giffords. ﻿ The problem is that none of these laws would have prevented that incident, nor would they have prevented any incident that has happened since then.
These laws are simply things that have been on the wish list of anti-gun groups since before the first AWB even passed. Anyone who can think logically rather than emotionally will find that none of these things would have prevented the tragedies we've seen.

Gabrelle Giffords: Proof that getting shot in the head does not make one smarter. She probably has no idea what she is saying or doing on a﻿ daily basis, which makes her a perfect liberal. At least she has the excuse of being partly brain dead from a bullet, what excuse do all the other liberals have for being so brain dead?

Let's start with VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES, "NOT MORE GUN LAWS", I'm counting on America to be BOLD and do something about these games kids are playing.
If these shooters have never﻿ had played these games hours on end, we would not even be debating this.
Isn't it interesting how media can care less, or give a rats ass about the MILLIONS OF BABIES BEING ABORTED, AMAZING, JUST AMAZING, SHAME ON YOU AMERICA, by the way I was adopted out at two weeks old, but may not have been here to say what I'm sayi

I don't know what is in their hearts, and quite frankly I don't care. What is fact, and what I was trying to point out to you and others is Israel's proficiency at taking care of their own people, much like our Republic in it's youth. An even greater fact still, hatred will blind any person, people or politic from seeing God's true vision of love for humanity. I don't have time to﻿ read the Talmud, that is because as of late I've been too busy reading the Holy Bible KJV.

James, I said I'm reading the Holy Bible, KJV. I didn't say I believed everything in it front to back. Much of it I doubt is true, even it were I wouldn't adhere to a lot of it, I would rebel and face the consequences, but the﻿ majority of the writing in red (Jesus) is what hits a nerve with me. The majority of what he said whether true or not it doesn't matter to me, it is beautiful and I feel it is the best way to live one's life.

Here's the point: If Liberals want﻿ a debate on LOGIC, let's debate.
But if their argument is: "Feel sorry for Gabby," then I'll be damned if I don't get a rebuttal. I'm not going to surrender my argument, my Constitutional Rights, nor my gun away because I "feel sorry" for someone.
If THIS is the Liberal argument, then we get a rebuttal: Liberals,﻿ your sorry-assed emotionalism does not substitute for a logical argument.

Well, there was one guard﻿ with a pea-shooter pistol. And Harris did indeed exchange shots with him and then fled from the guard (all these cowards flee from any sign of resistance), which enabled the guard to call for help.
There was another incident where an armed school security guard, indeed, shot a kid coming into the school with a rifle.
No one claims that security is a 100% guarantee.
The Columbine guard needed to be trained with a rifle. Then I'd at least give you an 85% guarantee.

They pulled this same b.s. arguing for universal health care. They﻿ pull Michael J. Fox, who purposefully didn't take his medications, on the Senate floor. Then he pours his water all over his shirt. And that is supposed to substitute for a logical debate.

Gun control advocates believe that a beaten, raped and strangled woman is somehow morally superior to a woman with a gun and a dead rapist at her feet.
"A woman﻿ who advocates gun control is like chicken who roots for Colonal Sanders."

People need to﻿ stop saying shit about Gabby Giffords. If any of the people shit talking her were in the same condition I doubt they would get the same attention because they are terrible people and probably deserved it. She isn't dumb or retarded. She got shot int eh fucking head. She is alive and better spoken than the people mocking her.

Here's the point: If﻿ Liberals want a debate on LOGIC, let's debate.
But if their argument is: "Feel sorry for Gabby," then I'll be damned if I don't get a rebuttal. I'm not going to surrender my argument, my Constitutional Rights, nor my gun away because I "feel sorry" for someone.
If THIS is the Liberal argument, then we get a rebuttal: Liberals, your sorry-assed emotionalism does not substitute for a logical argument.

I'm not﻿ a liberal. I don't identify as anything. I don't think the aim is specifically "Feel sorry for Gabby". Of course since she is a victim of a tragedy people will see it that way since her speech is marred, but she wants to keep all of America safe from guns in the wrong hands. She isn't trying to get guns ripped from angry paws. I believe it's all a matter of gun control, not gun repo or banning. I don't know why you chose to reply to my comment but this is what I think of the situation.

Oh, all this you attribute to "Gabby"? Is that what "she" wants? Aw, well I guess I cannot argue back, because that would make me insensitive.
Okay, here's my gun.
Even though gun control has proven to greatly increase murder, aggravated assault and rape, I won't argue that fact because I would be "insensitive"﻿ to Gabby.

The Liberal argument reminds me of their argument in favor of Communism: "Oh, we must feed the children, The Children, THE CHILDRENNNNN!" Into a blood-curdling﻿ hysteria. All EMOTIONALISM.
But the fact is that "children" in Communist countries are standing in bread lines . . . and the adults, too. While the Free Market children are eating steaks.
Same with gun control. Many more children are killed when gun control is enacted. But the Liberals are too emotional to have a logical debate.

"Shut the hell up" about our Constitutional rights? No, son, your little mealy mouth cussing does not equal the repeal of a Bill of Rights enumerated right.
The Bill of Rights is fundamental to the fabric of﻿ our nation. And frankly, it wouldn't even matter if the Liberals got the supermajority in Congress and a 2/3 ratification by the states to change the Constitution, because there will be war long before such a scenario would occur.

The second amendment was not meant for hunters or sports shooting. It was put in place to enable the people to protect themselves from an over reaching oppressive government. In order for the people to be able to rise against tyranny they need to have access to weapons equal to those of the government. The need for an assault rifle is nothing more than the evolution﻿ of the second amendment. You can't repel an oppressive government with bolt action rifles, shotguns and handguns.

Thank you ma'am for bringing a spark of decency into the mire of YouTube commenters. Though we may differ in our views, it is comforting to know that there still exist people with whom it is possible to speak to with respect and be treated﻿ in kind.

Dude, do not respond with hatred and bile. Be patient, fortify your argument with facts, and cut back on the name calling. The only thing﻿ an internet commentator hates more than someone who disagrees with them is someone who remains calm in the face of their mounting anger. Seriously, try it. It's good fun if nothing else if they just keep getting pushed to hilarious heights of impotent rage.

I believe that she spoke from the heart. I also believe that she allowed her passion﻿ to cloud her judgement. Would she have said the same thing if she was not shot in the head? I dont know.

The way she's reading the speech is exactly the same way I would expect to see an elementary schooler read an assignment, pronouncing each word slowly and individually and also speaking﻿ without really seeming to absorb any internal depth about the words she's saying. I'm not saying this to be political or anything (I'm in favour of more gun control in the states) but it sounds like she probably still has some significant brain damage from the shooting.

I think she is courageous and bold. But just because she has fought hard to speak and struggles to do so does not mean what she says is worth hearing. I'm sorry Ms. Giffords, but your statement sounds like one of the children who wrote letters to Obama - not because﻿ of the way you speak, but because of the words you uttered.

Gabrielle Giffords is incredibly brave. To have come as far as she has with the extent of her injuries is an amazing testament to her courage and resiliency. She has as much right to speak out for what she believes in as anyone.﻿
The NRA is constantly shouting about their rights. I want someone to talk about the rights of the victims of gun violence. What about that unalienable right to life? We create laws to protect our society and its time for both sides to have a civil conversation.

What courage. If I understand correctly the American debate centres around freedom, who should tell you what to do, or what﻿ you should own, right?
To an outsider this seems like you want anarchy, as little state control possible? For me, knowing many people around me would have guns would make me feel LESS free.
Anyway, just wanted to comment because reading some of the comments here it's pretty shocking from an outsider. Hmmmph, maybe just cultural difference.

I don't know what her situation was. I dont know if it was a point blank shot or a sniper from astray. Well the second question is in regards to that when guns are banned/highly restricted the crimes committed by knives skyrocket, so would she be in a better, same, or worse condition﻿ than she is now.

Why even comment then if you don't know your facts? 19 people were shot 6 killed so yes it would have been better result if it was a knife.﻿

i commented﻿ questions because I didn't know. Now back to the scenario that occurred, think it would be different if someone had a concealed weapon to defend themselves?

it certainly would have, but if the facility provided a background check (which everyone wants) then it would have been different. The problem is this movement wants to do more than background checks, they want to limit the capability for﻿ good people to defend themselves to an obscure level.

They should ban all guns, why the hell are you all so worried about defending yourselves? I live in a rough part of Belfast, there have been riots near my house for the last 8 weeks and I feel perfectly safe. I'm not remotely﻿ worried about someone attacking me or my home, why do you feel like people need guns? Too much TV.

Just bud out Euro puke. Who the hell are you to talk about security with your country crumbling around you?
Why don't you go out and do something in your﻿ own country, rather than trying to "fix" (LOL) America.
If you aren't concerned for your security in a riot, it's because you are naive. Evil people and out of control people hurt others.
Now bud out before we carpet bomb your village.

IN-secure? No, guns provide security.
And your﻿ belief about guns is wrong. When gun rights are introduced, murder rates plummet.
Mass shootings plummet over 700%. Apparently, coward mass murderers prefer UNARMED victims in gun-free zones! Duh, who knew?!

Japan has the lowest murder rate of any developed country America has the highest so your murder rate isn't exactly plummeting. If mass murderers could not buy a gun﻿ at the grocery store you wouldn't have to worry about mass shootings. The reason you are insecure is because you feel the need to buy a gun, you fear for your life while I drive about in a riot giving zero fucks.

Murder rates started falling when "RIGHT TO CARRY"﻿ laws were passed in the 1990's. They have PLUMMETED since. They are at rates similar to those in the 1950's, here. You don't know what the hell you're talking about.

It's not. Australia has higher murder and rape rates than the U.S. since they enacted gun control in the 90's.
To give you an idea: In the 90's American women were 3X more likely to be raped than an Australian﻿ woman. Today (after gun control, there, and gun freedom, here) women in AUSTRALIA are 3X more likely to be raped.
The science - doing LONGITUDINAL COMPARISONS - simply could not be clearer.

America has an extremely violent counter-culture﻿ in the Black community. Blacks accost white people on the streets, here. We also have a narco-state as our Southern border.
Mexico had more murders last year than in Iraq.

Indeed, ALL violent crime has plummeted in America since RIGHT TO CARRY was enacted.
And if you knew anything about SOCIAL SCIENCE, you'd know that you CANNOT scientifically compare Japan to America. It's comparing APPLES TO ORANGES. It's an experiment without any CONTROL. The proper way is to do a LONGITUDINAL study that compares BEFORE & AFTER. But you're too stupid to care about﻿ studies.

What? I just cited a statistic. Murder﻿ rate in your country 4.8 per 100,000, which is 4 times higher than the murder rate in my country 1.2 and 12 times higher﻿ than the murder rate in Japan 0.4. These are the important statistics, not your NRA funded research.

1. It's our second constitutional right, it essentially protects all the others.
2. Protects us from tyrannical government (IF that ever does happen, i'd rather have a right to defend myself)
3. Crime rates skyrocket after gun bans
4. It mainly attacks law abiding citizens.
5. Just look at america's history, we love﻿ guns and we haven't been able to ban anything effectively, since, ever.
6. It's a fun hobby, hunting and target shooting.
Those are the only things off the top of my head

The only ones that kill with them are the irresponsible ones, aka a very small percentage of all gun owners.
Owning a gun is a privilege. I'd rather have one than be defenseless.
Why do you care anyway? You're not even from the US.
And just for historical purposes, continental US wasn't invaded by the japanese military after the attacks on pearl harbor because they knew we﻿ all had guns and knew how to use them.

They declined to invade the mainland not because our citizens were armed but because strategically it was a bad idea ,,It would have been a suicide mission unless they had first amassed troops and﻿ readily available resources in strategic areas in order to sustain such and invasion , Moreover then as today our armed citizens are no match for and invasion by a professional army ,,

you are an idiot. You can not plan for an emergency. Want to ban guns? Then i propose that you not carry a cell phone, get rid of your home's fire extinguisher, never use your seatbelt either. See All of those﻿ are tools to help in case of an emergency, just like a firearm is. The 2nd Amendment clearly states "Shall not be infringed"... Think of "infringed" as a sweater with a loose string at the end and you pull it, and it unravels to nothing... You will not infringe upon my god given right

We applaud President Obama for working with the UN to finalize proposals for the nationwide ban on all privately owned guns.
The gun ban not only helps thwart further mass-shootings, but ensures the safety, preservation and﻿ continuity-of-government in the event of unforeseen natural, financial or man-made calamities resulting in civil unrest, widespread anarchy or looting by minority groups.
Only Law Enforcement shall retain the current Right to Bare Arms for population control and self defense.

Why don't you look it up, then? It was thoroughly reported in the news at the time, you can get all the information you need. And find out that in a knife attack, she probably wouldn't have been hurt﻿ at all.

Mrs Giffords,
I am sure Glad you are Recovering from the Gunshot wounds inflicted upon you from a Crazed Madman. With that being said, I Sincerely ask that you not try to infringe﻿ on the rights of millions of law abiding gun owners. We are not the Problem.

Loughner was a﻿ law abiding gun owner until he shot these 19 people, Adam Lanza's mother was a law abiding gun owner. Guns and gun owners are the problem not crazed madmen, you can't legislate for anyone going mad and doing this sort of thing, you have to legislate to make guns difficult to get.

Flawed train of thought FoFo. Remember Tim McVeigh? No guns used. Fertilizer, fuel, rental truck..you can't ban any﻿ of them. Remember 9/11? Widebody commercial aircraft. Thousands flying every day since. They won't be banned. Why??? Not enforceable, ineffective, unrealistic solutions. Gun bans & magazine restrictions..ditto!! You cannot legislate CRAZY!! But you can stop protecting crazy by releasing medical records from mental health caregivers before CRAZY try's to buy a gun or access Mom's!

You don't need a gun to travel from one place to another, you don't need bullets to grow crops. Your argument has no substance, just because other things are sometimes used as murder weapons you can't﻿ disregard that 68% of murders use guns. Guns could easily be banned completely and it would have virtually no impact on the lives of 99% of people other than making them safer.

Now your argument has no substance. If guns were banned completely, do you think the President would have no need for armed protection? Of course this hypocrisy would not allow this. Elitists have always﻿ thought this way. You cannot stop insanity or legislate it, so taking away my constitutional right serves no purpose in your argument. My state and Gov't allowed me to legally purchase my weapons and charged me sales taxes to do it. The same taxes the charge to put gas in your car to go vroom!

To suggest that gun owners "don't worry" about people losing their lives to guns is quite insensitive. The difference is here in the US, we don't take people's things away because we think they might get hurt. Also, if a gun ban is so easy to enforce then why are there 200,000+ (As high as 10 million from other sources) illegal guns﻿ in the UK according to the ACPO?

Firstly the government takes drugs away because people might get hurt so obviously you are clueless about the role of government. Secondly the figures you quote are 17 years out of date, before the gun ban was even introduced. The﻿ fact that you would even mention 10 million is so laughable, it shows you have no grasp on the relevance or plausibility of statistics.

The war on drugs is a whole different argument, I believe drugs should be legalized, also a huge amount of the gun violence you profess to dislike comes from said drug war. And if those stats are﻿ so unrealistic then explain why the Guardian (and many other news organizations from the UK) have countless articles like "Firearms: cheap, easy to get and on a street near you" from 2008 which explains in detail how absurdly easy it is to get an illegal firearm in the UK.

You said "in the US, we don't take people's things away because we think they might get hurt" I used drugs to illustrate how ridiculous your argument was. You don't even understand statistics, the important statistic which you are﻿ blatantly ignoring is that you're 14 times more likely to be shot dead than me.

I'm pretty sure the odds are worse than that, something like 200 times? However, the argument that you're making is﻿ basically that you don't mind being a victim, so long as the crime is not too severe. Kind of like suggesting women should allow themselves to be raped in hopes that the rapist doesn't hurt them. The reality is, however, that women are less likely to be raped if they resist, just like a person is less likely to be victimized if they use a gun for self defense.

If i lived in Chicago maybe, but I live in a state with more lax gun laws than Texas, if you can believe that, and guess what... You actually have a better chance of getting shot to death in the UK than where I live in the US (the whole state). The majority of our gun violence comes from high population﻿ areas, and many of these areas have strict gun control which funny enough, doesn't seem to work. Btw, you seem to be under the delusion that death from gunshot is worse than other causes.

Nationwide Americans are 14 times more likely to be shot dead than Brits and 4 times more likely to be murdered altogether. You are the deluded one if you think that's not a problem. What﻿ state do you live in? Are those per capita statistics? Do you understand how easy it is to bring a gun into a gun free zone and how this differs from bringing a gun into a gun free country?

those stats are correct. But, the cause of death is practically irrelevant unless you﻿ are advocating getting shot to death is worse than being bludgeoned or stabbed to death. Also you seem to be ignoring the same stats that show that most of the crime comes from the high population gun free zones. No offense, but I don't need to tell you where I live, if you cared, you would go to Statemaster(dot)com and look at all the states with equal or lower murder rates than england.

You must have been looking at "Homicide > Total number of victims" or "Gun violence > Number of﻿ homicides". You should have been looking at "Firearms Death Rate per 100,000" which shows every state is at least 10 times worse than England. You are so retarded you are quoting stats that you don't even understand, you probably come from a state of 2 million people and are comparing it to a country of 53 million.

You defaulting back to "gun deaths" instead of sticking to the arguments about total homicide/murder rates because they don't support your argument doesn't mean I'm retarded, or that I﻿ don't understand the statistics. It means you cant support your argument when we factor in other forms of death. You can call me all the names you want, it doesn't improve your flimsy arguments.

Wait do you not even realize the mistake you made? I asked you if the statistics you quoted are "per capita" and you responded by saying they "are correct". I had to look at those stats myself to determine they were not per capita and﻿ you had been quoting irrelevant murder numbers instead of murder rates. You thought you had solved the problem with you assertion that more crimes are committed in high population areas. I have no interest in debating someone who can't understand these figures.

You need to check out the FBI websit violent crime has went down steadily for the past 20 years, violent crime rate (per capita) in Brittian is almost 4 times greater﻿ than US because poeple in Brittian are easy marks for these types of crimes. Your statement is misleading, Brittian has less gun deaths because there are fewer guns but it is a more violent place to live because of the lack of people being able to defend themselves..

What the fuck are you talking about? Of course we care, we just don't think banning guns will work, nor do we think banning guns is the right thing to do. How dare you say that just because we don't agree with you, we don't care!
Ending the drug war would do more to curb violence than ANY gun ban. So would banning private prisons and reforming criminal rehabilitation.

okay, then, since you were kind enough to reply the first time. i would﻿ like to inform you that, even if you believe owning gun(s) is a good thing, i am not trying to change your opinion about that. however, there is no current scientific way to test who in particular will become a killer, and (frankly) owning military-type guns is unnecessary. if more people are allowed to own military-type guns, then who knows how many more people will be killed? so that's why many people want to ban them.

hey, ever seen the size of your brain, idiot? some people seem completely normal to others until they're caught doing something immoral. like jekyll and hyde. jekyll﻿ didn't get caught because no one suspected him, but he still had access to all the money and influence he had as jekyll. i know it's fictional, but it happens. so don't judge me so quickly when you don't know me.

(sorry, ran out of room on the first one) also, there is no way that people can ever FULLY have 1st and/or 2nd amendment rights. for example, would you say swear words in front of little children or given a known psycho a gun?﻿ i hope not. as locke said, we must give up some of our theoretically inalienable rights in exchange for safety.

Sorry, I am not willing to budge anymore on our inherent rights. Especially if they are just *Feel Good* laws that do not do anything to actually﻿ curb the issue. The whole use of "Military type weapons* shows a lack of understanding of the Firearms people want to ban. I cannot remember when a Actual Select Fire weapon was last used in a shooting. We cannot Legislate on emotion. If we do like we did in the past it will just show that it was a waste of time and our money and just doesn't help.

i'm﻿ sorry, you've already given away some of your inalienable rights, consciously or not. the price of being able to live in a society with other people is part of what locke calls your 'inalienable' rights. ever noticed how you're taught by people around you when you're little that you can't just do anything you want? that's that. by the way, what's your view on military spending?

Theoretically ???
Do you really think that after that "give up" the safety will be improved?
What will be your﻿ next "give ups" for the sake of safety and where is your limit ????
In the UK the most common tool for killing people is a knife.
What do you think about banning all knives?

i'm sorry. that wasn't the best way to word it. anyways, what i meant was that the social contract theory (john locke) states that, when people live completely by themselves, they can do whatever they want. however, they realize that they can be killed or harmed pretty much anytime. when they live with others, they﻿ must forgo some rights (must behave properly) to be able to help and be helped by others. i'm not talking about the ability to own anything in this case. have a good day.

" when they live with others they must forgo some rights (must behave properly) ..."
Why must they forgo their rights?? What does it mean to behave properly?
The best example of societies where people forgone 'some' rights and 'behave properly' are Northern Korea and Cuba.
In a free society a person has rights and freedoms ﻿ to do anything BUT !!!! he has NOT the right to violate other people's rights and freedoms.
You have a good day too

nononononono, that's not what i meant. basically, everyone﻿ who lives with other people has to follow societal rules or else get kicked out. like, if you're incredibly rude and violent or something, then people start avoiding you and you don't get the benefit of having other people looking out for you. even in the US, which many consider a 'free society', we must follow the laws set by the government. thus, people in any society cannot do JUST ANYTHING THEY WANT.

And she is some sort of authority on this matter because of ?
I was in an aircraft accident, doesn't mean I qualify as a NTSB investigator.
She was a NRA dick sucker for political sake and now since she's no longer a political prostitute she is speaking ill of then gun. That's so typical. Too bad she didn't really believe in personal safety and had a weapon on her the day of her shooting.
This cunt should just have her limo drive into the sunset while licking the rear﻿ window.

You subjects to the Crown gave up your rights willingly. Our's are preserved in the Constitution. That was done because the King tried to ban our colonies from receiving ball & powder. Then he went crazy after we told him to pound sand and we created our own gig. Your Brit Peirs is trying to push his own limey agenda upon Americans. He has been isolated and downplayed as a﻿ hack for the radical liberal left and has no credibility in the US media because he has no free thinking conscience. PAWN!

gabrielle giffords is a citizen of the usa and she has the right to bear arms but she is trying to get gun controls in. i have not got a problem with the right to bear arms for people to defend themselves but﻿ there are to many people it seems in america who use guns offensively

Just look at the ratio of available law enforcement﻿ to citizens who they are sworn to protect. There is no possible way they can protect the masses. We are on our own and must take responsibility for our own protection.

Right. It's like one officer for every 5,000 people.
Law﻿ enforcement could never possibly substitute for self defense. And who would want a police state big enough to do so?
Liberals are so stupid. As if putting on a blue suit and a piece of tin makes someone different. Police are just people with guns.

What would we do if guns didn't exist? Are we protecting ourselves from the Aliens from another galaxy? If war broke out what can your gun do? Why do we have the Military and the﻿ Police forces? There is a huge difference between the guns of yesterday and the ones of today. We don't live in the wild wild west do we? KEEP GUNS OUT OF CRIMINALS HAND by controlling illegal gun sales on the black market, back ground checks and tracking.

HuskyxBadger -Yes, I spoke of the Police and the Military because they are there to serve a purpose, right? Why would I restrict our protective force? Guns are﻿ evolving, some safer than others. Darling, some of us have anger problems, psychological disorder issues, and (insidious agenda's = criminals). There is GOOD and BAD, and that’s universal. So we have to act civil. Gun Control is simple and logic sense. Screening is vital. What do we have to hide?

So what happens to liberal politicians that are pro gun they get shot in the head because it would make too much sense to completely empower the people. Sounds a bit peculiar﻿ if you ask me. Mental checks would be an effective idea but the so-called common sense legislation is an insult to gun owners.

Are you seriously implying that the issue here is that Gabby Giffords chose a career path as a public elected official? Not the loose gun﻿ laws that don't require background checks. Not the senseless violence. Not the sick person who shot her, and all of the unnamed others. But the fact that she chose a career path where people may disagree with her opinions? Also, last time I checked, being shot is not a customary occupational hazard for representatives.

I have nothing but respect for this couple. Certainly, gun control will be a life-long passion for them. However, if our country gets swept up into anti gun ferver to pass bans, we will lose these rights forever. No going back. We will not be addressing real problems of mental illness and security. We will simply take guns out of the hands of millions to fearfully protect ourselves from the insanity of hundreds. Before we sign onto this,﻿ we need to address why people snap.

What needs to happen is once you are convicted with a weapon(gun, knife etc...) related crime﻿ the hand you used to commit the crime gets cut off. Simple, effective and to the point. No more weapon crimes :) Just the threat of the punishment would stop most from doing it.

Even with a head injury, Gabrielle Giffords has the pride and self respect to form full sentences and produce an argument that makes sense. If you really really care about this issue,, don't you want to present yourself as an intelligent and reasonable person? People who make empty threats and brag about "real manhood" destroy their own credibility.. Every time a guy like you chimes in,,﻿ I just see the defense of the 2nd amendment slip out the window.

After the government has disarmed the criminal elements, then they can disarm the average citizen. I don't have weapons to hunt animals, I have them to protect my family. Look at what's happened in Australia after﻿ citizens were disarmed: every violent crime statistic increased. Most disturbing is the increase in home-invasions. The answer to a violent society is an increase in prosperity.

I'm perfectly fine with more back groud checks, but banning guns or anything to do with them doesn't solve a single problem. it's simple common sense. people will always get guns no matter what. more protection is the only answer. it is the thing﻿ that has worked more than anything. assault weapon ban 1994- collumbine shooting and many others.

Figured id drop that out there before you Anti Gun nuts thought they wanted guns banned.

It took a lot of effort and courage fir Giffords﻿ to do what she did. All the skeptics, haters, and naysayers on this board dismissing her and her comment in the supposed name of "freedom" and "rights," until you have personally experienced having a high powered shell blown through your skull and pass clean through your brain at close range, I will assume you are just spouting out your cake hole!

If we banned guns, people like Adam Lanza could just as easily make a homemade bomb in their basement and blow up half the school or wait until recess to plow over 300+ kids with an F250. That's the brutal, harsh truth. The problem is not and will never be about guns. And pretty much 99.9% of the time, these shooters suffer from﻿ severe mental health issues or are products of poverty who had no role model to teach them right from wrong. The problem is social and mental, not material.

So they can kill even more kids with homemade bombs??? Do you not see how ignorant that sounds?? "Tools of hate". That's funny, because I know that there are several million responsible gun owners. Anyways, I highly doubt there will be a ban on guns, just stricter background checks and maybe﻿ soon a ban on automatic weapons, which I have no problem with.

You seriously need to learn how to read. I have absolutely 100% NO problem with a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines,﻿ but there has NOT been and will not be a ban on all guns. For god sakes, go read a damn news article and educate yourself on this issue. I agree 100% with Obama's proposal, AS LONG AS he keeps his promise on putting effort into researching the mental health issue. Clearly there is a lot to be learned from becoming an individualistic society.

This﻿ is my little theory on the mental health aspect of it..The problem with our society is as we become more and more about the individual, we lose our sense of community and group involvement with others. This can lead to some (e.g. Lanza) having severe isolation as individualism can lead to much harsher bullying and treatment by teenagers. People feel more alone now than ever, even with a growing population! And that leads to greater chance of mental breakdown by people, in my opinion.

Hussein Obama and his buddy Rahm Emanuel's model city of what they want the USA to become, Chicago, has a record 44 murders this month. Guns are﻿ banned for law abiding citizens there and I guarantee many of these murders would not have happened if guns were legal in that city. Just yesterday two children were murdered at a high school in Chicago, fatally shot﻿ to death. All this blood is on the hands of LIBERALS.

Send a shock wave to﻿ the extreme left. Sign the petition to repeal Senate Bill SBX211. When the entire Los Angeles Superior Court Judges face possible felony charges for excepting money that was NOT authorized by law. That should put them back on their heels for a while.
Google SBX211 and sign the petition.

Get someone﻿ that can actually read before you try and get a point across. This is painful to listen to.

yeah true.
I don't support idiots going in and killing people. I also don't support govts trying to outlaw the responicble ownership of guns.
maybe their﻿ should be checks and ballances of guns... IDK. but we need to slow down the slamming of "legal" drugs. and illagals. that 50% of the problem there. have you seen some of the side affects of these prescription medications :O

I see you are unfamiliar with the specific problems in the US. Likewise, the retort about knives if farcical. If they were so effective, they would be the primary combat weapon of the military. You should put that argument﻿ to rest if you want to be effective in making your point.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Near-freezing temperatures didn’t stop several thousand gun-control activists from bearing their pickets today, carrying signs emblazoned with “Ban Assault Weapons Now” and the names of gun violence victims in a demonstration organized as a response to the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn. last month.
Walking in silence, the demonstrators trudged between Capitol Hill and the Washington Monument over a thin layer of melting snow. They were joined by politicians and some families of the Newtown victims.
March organizer Shannon Watts said the event was for the “families who lost the lights of their lives in Newtown, daughters and sons, wives and mothers, grandchildren, sisters and brothers gone in an unfathomable instant.”
“Let’s stand together and use our voices, use our votes to let legislators know that we won’t stand down until they enact common sense gun control laws that will keep our children out of the line of fire,” she told demonstrators.
Watts founded One Million Moms for Gun Control after the killing of 20 first graders and six adults at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in December. In a profile with the New York Times, Watts said her 12-year-old son had suffered panic attacks after learning of last summer’s Aurora, Colo., theater shooting, leaving her at an impasse over how to talk to him about the latest tragedy.
Also among the speakers was a survivor of the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, Collin Goddard.
“We need to challenge any politician who thinks it’s easier to ask an elementary school teacher to stand up to a gunman with an AR-15 than it is to ask them to stand up to a gun lobbyist with a checkbook,” he said.
The demonstration comes amid a push by progressive lawmakers to enact stricter gun control measures as a response to the trend of recent mass killings, although any hypothetical bill would likely face strong opposition in Congress.
Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., was among the demonstrators today.
“The idea that people need high-capacity magazines that can fire 30, 50, 100 rounds has no place in a civilized society,” he said. “Between the time we’re gathered here right now and this time of day tomorrow, across America, 282 Americans will have been shot.”
The congressman was quoting statistics compiled by the Brady Campaign to Stop Gun Violence.
INFOGRAPHIC: Guns by the Numbers
Last week President Obama proposed a sweeping overhaul of federal measures regulating gun ownership, including a universal background check system for sales, banning assault weapons,  and curbing the amount of ammunition available in weapon clips.
An ABC News/Washington Post poll released Thursday found 53 percent of Americans viewed Obama’s gun control plan favorably, 41 percent unfavorably. The division was visible today, as a handful of gun-rights advocates also turned out on the National Mall to protest what they believe would be infringements on their Second Amendment liberties.
ABC’s Joanne Fuchs contributed to this report.

Something i don`t understand, they go after only guns, not video games, or violent television. With how many millions of assault type weapons and high capacity magazines out in the free world since the beginning of time, how are they going to void another psychotic individual from doing the same exact thing tomorrow morning. Educated Human behavior needs to be the focus of the witch hunt not Totalitarian fear mongering violating other peoples Constitutional Amended rights.rights. Going after something like this is like a shark eating its own guts, it has no idea of what it is setting into motion..
There were over 10,000 innocent children under age 18 killed last year in violent automobile accidents, many by DUI drunk drivers and Cellular telephones, text messaging while driving , whats the difference ? Human behavior while operating a vehicle on public roadways.?
These people have no closure, the assailant killed himself before the legal system could.

“The idea that people need high-capacity magazines that can fire 30, 50, 100 rounds has no place in a civilized society”
  If we lived in a “civilized society”, these tragedies would not have occurred.   The changes these people are marching for, will in no way improve the situation.    Try getting the government to enforce the laws on the books before you take away more freedoms.    Your right to protest may be the next.

FYI: Hundreds of thousands turned out in DC today for the March for Life. Early estimates on social media believed numbers around half a million, more than last year’s 400,000.
Naturally, the leftist-biased, fully corrupt MSM ignore this huge event, and they certainly won’t mention the massive numbers involved. Instead, they simply promote the socialist agenda to trash the US Constitution and its 2nd Amendment rights.

“The idea that people need high-capacity magazines that can fire 30, 50, 100 rounds has no place in a civilized society,”—————————————he should be shot by Mexico drug gangs with magazines that can fire 30, 50, 100 rounds. Certainly his party is not able to register those guns by Mexico drug gangs. They could not even register the illegal humans.

ABC News covers this, but NO MENTION of the hundreds of thousands who marched for life yesterday in D.C.? It’s hard to see how ABC can be more egregiously biased.  I’ve been an ABC World News views for some 45 years, and can attest that push their leftist agenda on EVERY BROADCAST now! Simply despicable.

Liberals decried the Patriot Act because it unconstitutionally deprived America it’s freedoms for a little bit of security.  The same thing is happening with this stupid gun control law: a little bit of security at the price of our constitutional freedom.  But liberals won’t defend the constitution b/c it’s their guy who is assailing it.  The hypocrisy of the left is astonishing.

Bush attempted to reinstate the last assault rifle ban, perhaps if congress would have passed it those kids would still be alive.

Liberals are all acting as if guns stand up on their own power, somehow find a place with unarmed victims to make a conscious decision to gravitate to, hop over to them on their own power, jump 3 feet in the air to break glass doors, magically grow an eye to take aim with, amazingly grow a trigger finger out of its solid oak gun stock, miraculously take aim on its own power and depress the trigger with amazing accuracy again and again.  Welcome to the warped mind of the radical left.




			Posted by: EPU | January 26, 2013, 6:25 pm 6:25 pm		



How many times do I have to say it? Guns DON’T kill people. PEOPLE kill people. Banning guns will only make things worse. Criminals don’t care about the laws, they will get guns one way or another. And when they use them on civilians in the commission of crimes, we won’t be able to defend ourselves. Sandy Hook was a big, elaborate hoax orchestrated by the Obama administration to use as an excuse to rouse gun control debates and take away our 2nd amendment right.

Of course this issue has nothing to do with all those gigantic profits.  It’s purely a matter of personal freedom.

If a person would believe that this was a hoax put together the the Obama administration, I would question why they would stay in a country that does such unholy things. I suppose they also believe Bush was behind 911.

There is person that goes around were you live that thinks that someone is mentally ill all the time and you wonder what that person is trying to do with your life.  The” right to life” is in U.S. Constitution and needs to be clarified.  Some think it only apples to the government applied power to end life.  The victims of gun violence are not protected by the U.S, Constitution in all cases arising when there is a loss of life in this country.  Take a person by civil action is not something I enjoy hearing.  What do you mean sir?  David

The fact that the Newton shooter didn’t use an assault rifle keeps getting ignored. He shot those children and teachers with pistols. Why is everybody ignoring this fact?

Shame on the anti-gun lobby for standing on the headstones of Sandy Hook victims as if they were soap-boxes, profiteering off the tragedy for their age-old agenda.  Shame on the anti-gun lobby, PUMA!

The people who want to regulate who someone marries and what women do with their vagina’s are against regulating guns. That makes a lot of sense.

There’s evil all over the world. I stay in the U.S. because I at least get basic human rights here. And no, I don’t think that Bush was behind 911. If you do your research about Sandy Hook, you will find that there are a ton of problems with how they say things happened. Very little adds up. Obama and the Democrats needed an excuse to get people to willingly give up their 2nd amendment right, this was the perfect opportunity.
Here’s a question, why do Democrats and the people of Newtown want to ban assault weapons? The alleged killer at Sandy Hook didn’t even use one. He used pistols!

UNKOWN: “Banning guns will only make things worse.” – - – NOBODY is trying to use legislation to ban all guns as you imply.  And if this claim has one shred of truth then why isn’t violent crime in Wester European nations with much much stricter gun control than what we have much worse off than the U.S.?

UNKOWN: ‘Criminals don’t care about the laws, they will get guns one way or another. And when they use them on civilians in the commission of crimes, we won’t be able to defend ourselves.” – - – Ah, there is that tried and true favorite fallacy conservatives love so much on this issue – the perfect solution fallacy.  Well then by that logic we should recind all laws of any kind since criminals will just find some way or another to commit their crimes.  And that last comment is just a stupid bald faced lie because people will still have hundreds of other makes and models for them to use to defend their homes, many of which are actualy better for defending themselves.  And many of those other weapons are better for using in a home defense situation than using an assault rifle.

It’s time for common sense.  This is the USA, not Mogadishu or Syria.  The pursuit of happiness is not conducive to people walking around armed with semi-automatic weapons, handguns, rifles, or whatever gun they happen to have an unhealthy obsession with.  If you feel that strongly about your precious guns, and your right to carry them among innocent chilldren and normal people just trying to live their lives, then go live in one of those 3rd world war zones.

Those guns float around and just raise havoc!! My rifle took my car to Walmart and bought ammo with a coffee can full of spare change I had laying around. When I asked why, it told me to mind my own business as it splashed on some Hoppes #9 and left again for a gun show “to find some companionship”. Look out liberals!! Fill your bathtubs and stay underwater, and breath through a tampon applicator tube, you’ll be safe there. Most guns don’t like moisture.

@Doctorfill – if I’m going to be across the table from someone in an argument, let it be someone who at least has a sense of humor. A tip o’ the hat to you, from someone who actually would like to see a lot less hardware floating around.
And the website says to stop posting comments so quickly. Say what? This was my second one.Talk about limiting debate LOLOLOL…

Root or main problems remain.  We have gun control laws that do not reduce drug and gang gun violence, nor did the assault weapon reduce violent gun crime, and was allowed to expire.  We have law enforcement and legislators unable to enforce current laws on felons, nor have they identified psychiatric patients who might harm themselves and/or others.  We have the loony left, who think it a bad idea to have armed guards in schools, when about 1/3 already do, so where is the logic in these folks.  If it is so dangerous to children and their psyche, then remove the guards forthwith.  If not, have the other 2/3 consider the same types of protection afforded the President’s children and members of congress, armed personnel, trained.  We have left and far left politicians willing to put into place unconstitutional legislation that effectively disarm more and more ordinary Americans, and fail to address the criminals, only the objects of their crimes.  Kind of dumb in a constitutional republic.  We will see if Harry Reid, who faced re-election, will put up for a vote in the Senate legislation that will probably fail, like the assault weapon ban.  It will even be more telling, if the President issues an executive order extending the ban, despite the vote of Congress and the will of the people, and that pesky little document, the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.  THEN Americans will see just how hard left our turn has been, hurtling us toward a European model and a new world order.  Americans clearly should be concerned if they are not already concerned.

None of the gun control measures would have had any impact on the shooting. These people are being misguided and exploited.

So in a home defense situation, you have a weapon that can fire 3 rounds before you have to reload. The criminal has a weapon that fires 20 rounds before reloading. You think you’re going to win in this situation? Lol nice logic there.

On Wednesday, as part of a sweeping set of proposals related to guns and violence, President Barack Obama said that he would ask Congress to “fund research into the effect that violent videogames have on young minds.”
Additionally, a fact sheet released by the White House stated that the Obama administration proposes that the Center For Disease Control conduct research into “the relationship between video games, media images, and violence.”

The alleged shooter killed himself immediately after the killings. 2 handguns were found in the school. The rifle was found in the trunk of the shooter’s car. There is video evidence of police taking the rifle out of the trunk when they searched the car to confirm this. Therefore it is impossible for the rifle to have been the murder weapon.

These poor people put their faith and trust in government school officials, and government police force and both government agencies failed them completely.  CATASTROPHIC GOVERNMENT FAILURE to do it’s basic job – protect children, and show up when a crime is in progress.  Police took 20 minutes to arrive.  Where were the police for 20 minutes.  It’s a small town and the police station is TWO minutes away.   Parents should learn from this GOVERNMENT SCREW_UP and demand that their children’s teacher carry concealed and/or an armed guard be present at the school.  
No one says, I don’t feel safe in a bank because there is an armed security guard. No one says, I don’t feel safe in a jewelry store because there is an armed guard.  Parent need to take greater responsibility to protect their children at the moment of a an attack.  It’s called a layered defense.  I realize many teacher and adults would rather cower during an attack.  Do we want cowards in charge of our children?

I know it Knightrider because Connecticut is one of the states that has the strictest gun laws in the country. Adam Lanza was turned down TWICE when the tried to purchase a gun. Yet, he STILL got a gun to shoot the school. 
It’s not the guns that cause the crimes or even the mental illness. It is the DETERMINATION of the mentally ill individual. If the mentally ill individual is DETERMINED to commit the violence, he WILL have a gun.

It didn’t take any ‘determination’ for this killer to get his weapons – he just had to reach into his mother’s closet and he was fully armed and ready to slaughter.

UNKOWN: “So in a home defense situation, you have a weapon that can fire 3 rounds before you have to reload. The criminal has a weapon that fires 20 rounds before reloading. You think you’re going to win in this situation? Lol nice logic there.” – - – Yes, because I don’t miss.  And where did you get the three rounds from?  And anyone is such a bad shot that they could not stop an intruder with both barrels from a side by side is so bad having their own assault rifle won’t make any difference no matter how big their magazine is.  The tube magazine of a 12 gauge pump holds more than three rounds, plus one in the chamber.  Even the smallest internal magazine for medium and large caliber pistols holds more than three rounds, plus one in the chamber.  And revolvers hold more than three rounds.  And again, I don’t miss.  I qualified expert on six different weapons (including two pistols) and spent five years on competive rifle teams.  If I can see my target I don’t need more than one shot, especially at the close range of a home defense situation.  Granted, I am not nearly as good at trap or skeet.  But I don’t expect to have to worry about shoot ing small flying targets in my home.  And if I can’t see the target but have a good idea where it is and which wall it is behind dry wall is not stopping a twelve guage firing either 00 or a slug, nor medium or large caliber pistols firing anything other than those low penetration birdshot rounds.

B-K “I dont miss”
and in a actual situation….your adrenaline is pumping along with your heart rate…which throws off aim. 
Look at the number of police incidents where officers have fired dozens of rounds each (at close quarters and point blank range) and never hit their target. Or where they fire 18 shots and hit the target 1-2 times (when the bad guy wasnt even hiding behind any cover)…
and you are saying you are better than these trained people? Most training is for incidents withing 20 ft. As thats where most of the “action” happens. Police miss all the time…but you claim you can kill your intruder with one shot? Strange…people get shot multiple times and still live.

Not everyone has the same experience and skill involving guns. Against a criminal who fully intends to kill them, they would lose. The criminal will have shot them several times before they can even fire at them.

Ok…several thousand anti-gun advocates marched on Washington to show their hate of guns. Imagine a march of all those whose lives, safety and property was saved and protected by guns within the last year alone. The difference would be on a scale of 100 to 1 And you wouldn’t hear a peep of coverage from ABC News.

Yeah, sort of like the GA lady with 2 small girls who put 5 slugs into a pervert who was after her and her girls. Her husband taught her to shoot…and did a mighty fine job. Did the pervert ever die? Save us some tax money if he did. Similar to the gal in OK who has now shot 2 perverts…different occasions. Some folks never learn do they? Are we more than happy those two women had loaded guns and weren’t afraid to shoot? You betcha.  Apparently they are also pretty good shots in Chicago. Haven’t seen too many folks marching there. What’s wrong? Expendable, I guess.

It didn’t take any ‘determination’ for this killer to get his weapons – he just had to reach into his mother’s closet and he was fully armed and ready to slaughter.
Posted by: Stan | January 26, 2013, 10:00 pm 10:00 pm 
He had to MURDER his mother first, which is a CRIME. Criminals don’t care about laws. Criminals LOVE your idea of disarming law-abiding citizens. Makes their work that much easier.

MARK78: “and in a actual situation….your adrenaline is pumping along with your heart rate…which throws off aim.” – - – Yep, and for me that might mean hitting the nine ring instead of the period.  At worst it would mean hitting the five ring instead of the period.  And you know what that would mean when I am aiming center mass?  Hitting the edge of the heart and around the heart instead of the center of the heart.  And that would be if I was using a pistol or a rifle.  You know what missing my aiming point by six inches with a 12 guage firing 00 buck or a slug would mean?  One dead intruder.  And much adrenaline do you thing the intruder is going to be dealing with when he hears that twelve guage pump chamber a round and I confirm that was the sound he heard?  And even if I do manage by some miracle to miss with my first shot how much adrenaline do you thing the intruder will be dealing with after the first shot nearly takes him out?  Unless that person is used to getting shot at with a 12 guage and taking near misses he won’t have a friggin prayer.  Besides, I don’t miss, not at targets that big at such a close range.

You’re obviously not an American and you sure don’t know anything about American history. Loaded weapons were MORE accessible in American homes in the past than they are now. Loaded rifles mounted above fireplaces were commonplace throughout the country. Children used to take their shotguns to school with them! We didn’t have strict gun laws in our major cities. And yet gun crime was much, much lower.

B-K, I shoot often..I’ve taken several pistol courses….I actually have more hours training than officers in a lot of major police departments.
and I know that there is a BIG difference between shooting at a defenseless paper target vs at someone intent on causing injury or death coming at me. 
Congrats on being on shooting teams…that takes a lot of skill. But again, what’s your worse opponent? the paper target? the time clock? Until you are in a actual situation….go with those that have been, like the police that say they NEED 15-18 round magazines because they know WTSHF, shots WILL be missed. They also recommend people purchase pistol that can hold 15-18 rounds just for that same purpose for self defense when someone breaks into your home.

Adam Lanza wasn’t an NRA member. Criminals don’t care about laws. The fact that murder is illegal didn’t stop Lanza from killing his own mother before he went to Sandy Hook. Anyone who truly wants to commit mass murder can find a way to do so.
Mass murder in the Middle East is routinely done with explosive vests and improvised bombs. African countries have a long history of mass murder done with machetes.
James Holmes’ apartment was full of improvised chemical explosives. He was obviously capable of killing a large number of people whether he owned an AR-15 or not.

If not having/using a firearm on another human being while committing murder is love, then Ted Bundy loved more than 30 women to death with a hammer or any other handy heavy object.  John Gacy loved more than 50 young boys to death by strangulation.  The tobacco companies love more than 100,000 to death annually for more than 100 years.  This list is a bit long.  Wouldn’t it be better to chose logic over love?  Love tells us to ignore the felon at the door.  Logic tells us to do otherwise.  If you want to show your love, address the real causes that put individuals in a position to make a bad choice and focus on the environment that allows them to make the wrong choice.




			Posted by: wantingbalance | January 26, 2013, 10:56 pm 10:56 pm		



Why do the Obama democrats exploit tragedies like these but don’t actually do anything to solve the problem. I mean there will always be mentally ill people in our society and especially since they emptied the institutions and threw these people out onto the street. I would think that if you chose “love” then you would protect those you care about. Pretending that bad people won’t get guns and kill people is not really “loving” someone it is something you are saying to make yourself feel better. But if you truly love someone you have to ask hard questions —the first one being how many of those lives could have been saved in that school if their had been armed teachers, principals  guards??? It is just being an adult and dealing with the facts not emotions. Criminals will always have guns because they are criminals–come on let’s face the facts here by putting armed guards in every school.

Of course it will be. Atomic bombs are not the fault of atomic bombs, therefor everyone should have the right to an atomic bomb. Not likely. Laws all over the country limit the type of weapons people are allowed to own – and who allows to own them.
The 2nd amendment says the people’s right to arms shouldn’t be infringed, so how come you infringe already – on the rights of the crazy to hold weapons?

Wrong again. Like other major industrial cities in the US, Chicago had a major rise in violent crime starting in the late 1960s. 
Like most major American cities, Chicago has also experienced a decline in overall crime since the early 1990s. 
Murders in the city peaked first in 1974, with 970 murders when the city’s population was over three million.
Murders were at about 500 last year.

It sounds more like YOU’RE grasping and speculating.
You don’t need firearms to commit mass murder.
One of the worst mass murders committed in the 20th century in the United States was undertaken by a man with less than a gallon of gasoline and two matches. He killed 80 people and is currently in prison for life.
It’s estimated that between 500,000 and 1 million people were killed during the Rwandan Genocide in 1994. It was largely done with machetes.
Jim Jones, the founder and leader of the Peoples Temple, was responsible for the mass suicide in 1978 of 914 of its members in Jonestown, Guyana, and the murder of five individuals at a nearby airstrip. Over 200 children were murdered at Jonestown, almost all of them by cyanide poisoning.
Timothy McVeigh used a truck bomb to nearly instantly kill 168 people and injure over 800 in Oklahoma City in 1995. No firearms were involved.

If you feel so strongly about your position, then post a large “Gun Free Zone” sign in your front yard. You’re peace-loving, right? So you have nothing to worry about.
Many women have been murdered when strict waiting periods prevented them from obtaining a gun to protect themselves from a violent boyfriend or husband.

First off, the only reason he got into the school was because he SHOT his way through a window.  Then, like the teachers would let a guy wielding a knife and a can of gasoline harm the kids, and like he would have had enough time to pull the same stunt if those were his only weapons.  And like he could stab his way through a locked door to get into a classroom.   ROFLMAO  Oh, and if using a knife and a can of gasoline is so easy to do and so effective then why doesn’t that happen as often as murders with guns?  Oh yeah, because guns are MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE, and any idiot can use them effectively to quickly generate a large casualty count.  Unlike a knife, you can’t block a bullet unless you wear body armor every time you leave home.  And you can’t outrun a bullet.  And unless you are already about 200 meters away and lucky enough to see the muzzle flash you can’t dodge a bullet.  And it is much easier to take cover from getting stabbed.  And it is much easier to survive a stab wound than a bullet wound, especially one from a hollow point.  ROFLMAO

EVERY time a murderer has to stop killing to reload presents OPPORTUNITIES for people to save themselves.  EVERY time a murderer has to stop killing to reload presents OPPORTUNITIES to tackle the shooter, to hit the shooter with a blunt object as a weapon, to run away, to get out of the effective accuracy range for the skill of the killer, to take cover, to get into a room and lock and block a door.  What stopped the Tuscon shooter?  A middle aged woman grabbed his fresh magazine and hand while he was reloading his Glock.  EVERY time a killer has to stop killing to reload presents a chance greater than zero to survive some way.  I bet even five year olds have seen enough on TV to understand that concept.

factually inaccurate.  Jared Loughner wasn’t tacked while he was reloading.  He was tackled when his gun jammed.  Look it up: jared loughner gun jammed.  It’s documented fact.  Not some pro-large-magazine conspiracy fly-by-night blog; real-life newspapers like the LA Times.  PUMA!

That is just a ludicrous crock.  Is it hypothetically possible to commit as much carnage with revolvers?  Well, technically yeah, if EVERYTHING possible went EXACTLY the best way possible for a killer.  If nobody tried to resist or hide, if nobody called the cops, if it took forever for the police to respond, if none of the teachers locked the classroom doors, and on and on.  Anyone that lucky needs to be playing the lottery.

Second, not according to the woman (61 y/o Patricia Maisch) who grabbed his fresh magazine and hand while he was reloading and stopped him from shooting more people.  I have seen her in an interview talking about the shooting and stopping him.  And now that I think about it, her rather whitish hair kinda means she is not middle aged, as her 61 years attests.  Anyway, the way she stopped him while he was reloading gave several men enough time to tackle him and wrestle him to the ground, where she joined the dog pile.

KIM and the person who first posted the question:  “You were asked why do you think these new weapons are designed to look like military slaughter weapons now, instead of hunting rifles?” – - – Actually, civilian assault rifles like the AR-15 are not “designed to look like military slaughter weapons,” for all practical purposes the ARE military “slaughter weapons” that have been modified to fire only in semi-auto mode.  An AR-15 is just an M16 modified to not have a full auto or burst mode capability and then given a different name.  But other than that the AR-15 has ALL of the same charactersistics that makes an M16 an assault rifle.  So, except for lacking a full auto capability, an AR-15 is functionally identical to an M16.  If you take an M16 and break the selector switch so it is stuck in semi-auto guess what you have, and AR-15.

The problem with history is that very little is taught in school, what is taught is filtered with political correctness, what remains is slept through or forgotten after the test.   
The elite ruling classes have always found excuses to disarm the lower classes.   Cesar and Attila the Hun did the same thing.  Peasants in medieval Europe weren’t allowed to own arrows designed for hunting or defense.    A few centuries ago the Japanese Samurai carried swords but peasants were not allowed to touch one.   The Samurai were expected to behead anyone who insulted them.
The so called Five Civilized Tribes were disarmed before being driven from our land.  About a fourth lost their lives.   Over 4,000 Cherokee.   Then of course came Hitler, Stalin and Lenin.  (Vladimir, not John.  John spelled it Lennon)  Hitler killed 6 million Jews and a few million other people.  
Full automatic .45 ACP Thompson sub-machine guns and .30-06 Browning Automatic Rifles were available to civilian Americans until the 1930s.  The Thompson had 30 round stick magazines as well as 50 and 100 round  drums.   Western ranchers had them before our military did.   The BAR used a 20 round magazine.  
Semi-auto .30 caliber M-1 Carbines with 10, 15 and 30 round magazines were available to civilians after WW2.   (not much good past about 75 yards)  
The point is that attempts to disarm the proletariat are nothing new and it never works out well for those who are disarmed.   Rifles capable of rapid sustained fire aren’t new either and today’s civilian weapons are tame compared to those our grandfathers had.   
Absentee parents and parents too busy to raise their kids is a new development and it hasn’t turned out well.   Adam Lanza hadn’t seen his father in several years.  The boys from Columbine reportedly made bombs at the kitchen table.   Evidently the parents weren’t paying much attention to their kids.  
Those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who kept their swords –Benjamin Franklin.
Luke 22:36 – “Then said he unto them, He that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.”  – Jesus Christ

Murders in the city peaked first in 1974, with 970 murders when the city’s population was over three million.
Murders were at about 500 last year.

Thanks for the history. I don’t think in any previous era were these weapons – designed to look like military slaughter weapons = as easily and commonly available, as sleekly and aggressively marketed, nor as necessary to prop up the fading male machismo.
Canada has absentee parents and busy parents, and video games and movies, but our per capita murder rate is three times higher and they don’t have anywhere near the frequency or intensity of mass murders.
My guess is they do not have a ‘slaughter gun’ culture, nor mentality.

B-K Knightrider –  The army dismissed the Thompson for some reason.   Western ranchers liked the gun for some other unknown reason.  Vacationing gangsters saw the guns out west and brought them back to Chicago.  Cops had to keep up and finally the Army took a second look. 
I challenge you to find two modern civilian rifles bigger than .22  (other than H&H)  that weren’t originally designed for a military application.   The only one I can think of is the Hi-Point Carbine.   I don’t know who would buy one.   Almost all bolt actions are Mauser copies.   Leaver actions are based on Winchester rifles originally built for US forces during the civil war.  
The characteristics of the M16 – M4 rifles are what makes the AR15 so popular.   Ergonomics and adaptability.   Pistol grips and adjustable stocks are used in almost every target rifle made including those used in the Olympics.   With an adjustable stock my 5 foot daughter can shoot the same AR that her 6’3” grandfather shoots.   The AR is adaptable to almost any use with a variety of calibers and barrel designs.   Bipods can be added as well as a variety of scopes, lazar sights, lights, recoil compensators and a lot of other junk that I’ve never found a use for.  Mine has a 6 position stock, 3-9 variable power scope and a recoil compensator.   
Or you can assume that everyone is playing Rambo.    I own a few SAA revolvers too but I’m not trying to be John W Hardin or Wild Bill.  I just like the way they shoot.  As far as I know the Bisley model was only used for target competition.   I can hit typing paper at 50 yards with mine and I’m far from competition level.  It’s a really sweet gun to shoot.

I respect your opinion.  That length of time also happens to be about two and a half seconds, or less, if he just drops that gun and starts shooting the other one in his other hand.  If you can tackle someone within two and a half seconds (e.g. there’s three of you surrounding him, you’re tackling him from behind), you can tackle him while he’s still hot.  Basically, if you’re in a crowd shooting into a crowd, you’re going down.  If you’re in a crowd getting shot at by someone not in that crowd, you’re in deep trouble (unless you have a gun, too) whether the shooter’s got a 10 shot pistol, 7 shot pistol, 10 shell shotty or a 30, 50, or 100 shot assault weapon.

OONOGIL – The Thompson submachine gun is notoriously difficult to control, and is essentially a short range, short burst weapon in combat. As a single shot device for killing animals that prey on livestock, they are OK. When I was introduced to one in bootcamp 42 years ago, the instructor told us right up front that the only thing they were really good for was intimidation, since “everybody on the other side of the hill knows they are going to die.”

You’ve missed the point. by seeming to embrace the fallacy that irrational people have used and only will use firearms to kill, so that outlawing them will reduce the violence or the body count. Do you think that insurgents and suicide bombers in the Middle East use assault weapons to kill? Explosives are much more effective. How many assault weapons took down the towers in NYC or were involved in the Oklahoma City attack? Serial killers like John Wayne Gacy, who alone killed more young people than the Sandy Hook shooter, don’t use firearms because they don’t want to get caught and want to kill again. Gun control laws will keep outlawed guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens, and may reduce the number of spontaneous killings, but in my opinion will not deter or have any effect on people determined to kill as many as people as they can.

CUOMOCRAT FOR RUBIO: “That’s offensive! I would never personally attack a fellow blog commentator like that.” – - – That also happens to be true.  And that is the only time I am ever so bluntly honest.  By now I have probably responded to dozens of comments where you made patently false claims and used several times as many locical fallacies to prop up irrational claims and hollow opinions.  You provide the evidence and then I identify it and I have been doing if for months.  Changing your screen name makes no difference.
CUOMOCRAT FOR RUBIO: ““Jared Loughner gun jammed.” Does it turn up results? Are the results credible?” – - – ROFL  We can also turn up results about how NASA faked the moon landing.  It is possible to turn up results for almost any lie and conspiracy theory you can think off.  There are plenty of search results for the Mooners, the Truthers, the Birthers, and now the Hookers and many many others for which I don’t have a catchy name.  Not only can I turn up results about the woman who stopped him while he was reloading, I SAW her and HEARD her in an interview talking about what happened and what she did.  I will take her word over anything you can find on the Internet.

The only reason the son got his hands on it was because she didn’t have it (or the  handguns he also had) locked in a gun safe and disabled with locking mechanisms the way a responsible gun owner would have and in some states by law REQUIRE owners with minors in the household to do.

“MyTake@ 3:11 am – What I’m saying is that gun control laws are not and never will be the solution that most gun control advocates believe and argue that it will be.” To which I would have to reply that from a historical perspective you are largely correct. Having been a founding councilmember of a new suburban city, we were encouraged by by our police to add new laws beyond adopting county and state codes in place, to “add additional arrows to the quiver.” It happens regularly as pressures build through growth… rural becomes suburban, suburban becomes urban and crimes grow proportionately with population density. The fact is, that if you were to allow urban cities to exercise more control over guns, a large percentage of what is currently happening within them WOULD stop. However, the random deranged lunatic, determined to do the ugliest thing possible, will always be out there. Under our current system of laws, we really need to require those who would own guns capable of distributing high-volume death to keep them under extreme lock and key. And since I know they are not cheap, we use systems of heavy fines for enforcement.

No it wasn’t.  Jared Loughner’s gun jamming provided the sufficient time for the 61-year-old woman to disrupt his reloading… and clearing the jam.  Besides, if someone is firing away in front of you, shooting away from you, why would you wait until he reloads before you jump on him and secure his shooting hand?

We’ll let the reader decide if it’s credible.  The reader can decide if Sam Quinones and Michael Muskal of the Los Angeles Times was credible when they wrote in the Los Angeles Times on January 09, 2011, an article of record, not an op-ed, not some blog post, “when a woman in the crowd, already wounded, attempted to grab the gun from him. He finally changed the magazine and tried to fire, but the gun jammed. Meanwhile, two men from the crowd grabbed him and subdued him.”  Fact.  The reader can decide if John R. Emshwiller, Devlin Barrett and Charles Forelle are credible when they write in a Wall Street Journal article, article of record, not some op-ed or blog, “Mr. Loughner shot 18 others, six fatally, including the judge and a 9-year-old girl, before his gun jammed and he was wrestled to the ground.”  Or if those are faked-moon-landing, birther, truther conspiracy theory articles because they don’t fit the big-money gun-ban-lobby’s gun-ban agenda.  PUMA!

Deputy Jason Ogan gave the following account:

When the suspect tried to load a fresh magazine into his weapon, Maisch was able to grab the bottom of the magazine and prevent it from being inserted. This pause in shooting allowed for two men, Roger Salzgeber and Bill D. Badger, to tackle the suspect to the ground and restrain him until deputies arrived.

It IS a chicken and egg argument, because you claim that allowing her to purchase the weapons, rather than her irresponsibility as a parent and gun owner, was the root cause of the shootings. It wasn’t. Gun ownership and possession DO NOT always lead to shooting incidents (180M firearms and nowhere near that many shootings) but that irresponsible behavior and/or criminal intent are ALWAYS involved in shooting incidents. And based on the definitions of “egg” and “sound” you’re arguably wrong concerning both  the chicken/egg and falling tree conundrums. Evolutionary theory cannot clearly delineate of when a chicken became a chicken, and creationist theory maintains that God created chickens, not eggs. Second, although some discriminate between “sound” as the vibration of air and “noise” as the perception of sound the primary definition of “sound” in my Webster’s is “That which is heard” which requires the presence of someone to hear it.] and most definition use the terms interchangeably.

So you think we should just issue the guns to people who have exhibited disturbed behavior? Or do you think we should be applying some kind of psychological criteria?




			Posted by: Stan | January 27, 2013, 4:01 am 4:01 am		



MYTAKE: “It IS a chicken and egg argument, …” – - – No, it is not.  You really don’t understand the fundamental and necessary form of a chicken or egg argument.  Such an argument appears paradoxical because it depends upon knowledge that is impossible to know.  Since neither condition applies to the Sandy Hook incident the chicken and egg analoy is not appropriate.  We know for a FACT that he got the guns from his mother, which she had ONLY because it was legal for her to have them because she got them legally.  If she had not gotten them legally she would not have had them.  If she did not have them he could not have gotten them from her.  That is simple and irrefutable logic, with no unknowns, and without an apparent paradox.  Figuring out the chicken or egg question requires one to apply proper logic to the known facts to determine the one unknown detail that starts the chain of interdependent events that reveals the facts we do know  Again, the egg came first.

B-K KNightrider – “The ONLY solution most gun control advocates are striving for, and the ONLY thing Feinstein’s bill strives for, and the ONLY thing I have suggested, is to reduce the casualty count. If it only saves one life then it is worth having it.”
The problem I have with your point of view is that if saving ONE life is worth restricting a right, then what happens when people are STILL killed by firearms? The only logical progression is to ultimately ban ALL firearms since only the complete absence of firearms will prevent anyone from being killed by them. That is, in my opinion, the underlying agenda of Feinstein, Cuomo, and others. Another danger I see  is that claiming that the mechanism, rather than the perpetrator, is the root of the problem puts ownership and other rights of non-violators at risk.
“Since you freely acknowledge with the restrictions you find acceptable that we can in fact have restrictions then the only rational debate to have is over where to draw the lines.”
Yes, I believe that there are restrictions – that gun ownership should be licensed and require background checks, that all firearms owners must pass firearms safety courses, that certain firearms (like fully automatic weapons) should require very instensive background checks and special use licenses, and similar measurers. But my view is that restrictions should target those who want to own and use firearms, not attempt to identify which firearms are “acceptably safe” and which are “unacceptably dangerous” the way that alcohol, motor vehicles, prescription meds, and other potentially dangerous products are controlled.
The site is complaining that I’m posting too fast, so I’m going to have to give it up for the night. Final comment – there IS no simple solution.

I choose to practice with my gun, and carry it at all times. I choose to own the most best gun for the task for home defense, I choose the AR15 home defense rifle.   I also chose to march at a similar event held for those who support and defend the constitution and bill of rights a very short time ago that had as many if  not more people, but the media didn’t cover our march, it doesn’t support THEIR agenda.

MYTAKE: “And based on the definitions of “egg” and “sound” you’re arguably wrong concerning both the chicken/egg and falling tree conundrums.” – - – Wrong on the latter.  You need to use a physics book and not a dictionary.  “Sound” is a series of rarefaction and compression waves that propogate through a medium.  Thus, “sound” is not in any way dependent upon whether or not an aural organ/sensing system (aka an ear) is present to detect the sound waves and convert them into a sensation of hearing.  If a tree falls it MUST cause a series of rarefaction and compression waves (aka sound) as it passes through the air (the wave propagation medium) and it MUST cause a series of rarefaction and compression waves (i.e. sound) when it impacts the ground (another wave propagatioon medium).  Ergo, it must make sound.  You are confusing sound with noise.  Noise is a sound that an aural organ/sensing system detects and converts into a sensation/perception of sound.

STAN “So you think we should just issue the guns to people who have exhibited disturbed behavior? Or do you think we should be applying some kind of psychological criteria?” – If that behavior has caused the individual to appear on police or public radar as a possible danger to self or others, they should immediately be posted on a “NO SELL” list distributed to gun sellers authorized to sell and ship into those areas. What everyone has seemed to overlook is that there ARE ways to restrict transportation of guns by common carriers, particularly by classifying them as a category of hazardous cargo and strict enforcement of sales tax collection, so a dent can be made in their access to weapons from both outside and inside each state. Within the training/safety certification process someone displaying significant irrational or irresponsible behavior would certainly be trigger a closer inspection… but trying to put the government in the psychiatric evaluation business is not realistic, those triggers and the systems used for identification and societal intervention have to occur outside of the basic licensing and purchasing process. Government bureaucracies administer laws and fines and collect taxes, and then provides funding for specialist organizations (read hospital, fire, police etc) in those areas.

Ok ok, so we disagree on the facts.  You have a point; I have a point.  Let’s just agree to disagree.  So if you’re right and changing magazines puts you in such a vulnerable spot… e.g. it takes two seconds, you could stove-pipe on recharge… how is that a good thing?  No, seriously, if I wake up in the middle of the night with my spouse in the bed, children upstairs and L on the night-stand because three armed burglars broke in, why do I have to put myself in a vulnerable spot ever 10 shots?  You know, assuming they’re law-abiding citizens and are carrying Obama-compliant 10-shot magazines, there’s going to be 30 shots between them at the ready!  And they probably brought extra magazines!  What is 10 rounds in the well going to do for me and my family?

MYTAKE: “And based on the definitions of “egg” and “sound” you’re arguably wrong concerning both the chicken/egg and falling tree conundrums….Evolutionary theory cannot clearly delineate of when a chicken became a chicken” – - – Wrong on the former also.  The question itself necessarily means that at one time in the past there were no chickens.  According to proper application of evolutoinary theory chickens didn’t become chickens.  Either a species of egg laying non-chicken bird evolved into the chicken, or two species of egg laying non-chicken birds interbred to make the first chickens.  We can safely rule out a horse, or a dog, or rat or any other non bird species or non egg laying species making the first chickens.  And we can also safely rule out frogs, or turtles, or allegators or any other non bird egg laying species as making the first chickens.  Also, biology/evolution can tell us that only an egg laying species of non chicken birds can be the parents of another egg laying species.  In other word, changing from live birth to egg laying is impossible because that much change cannot happen that fast.  So again, that gets us back to either a species of non chicken egg laying bird evolved sufficiently for minor mutations to cause the laying of the first chicken eggs, or two species of non chicken egg laying birds interbred to lay the first chicken eggs.
I am not a creationist so I reject that out of hand.  Also, God could have created the non chicken birds wich interbred to make chickens.  In all fairness I have to admit to the possibility that aliens brought the first chickens.  And that an ancient but now extinct advance civilization used genetic engineering to grow the first chickens without using an egg.  But we have ZERO evidence to support the possibility that God did it, or aliens did it, or that an ancient civiliazation did it.  The only evidence we have supports the egg being first as the most probable answer.  But we cannot know that with 100% certainty.  So beyond a REASONABLE doubt will have to be sufficient.

James2000 “….I choose the AR15 home defense rifle.” And if you are sitting on 20 acres in rural use zoned county land I don’t have any particular argument with you as long as you make a reasonable effort to keep it safely in your possesion. It’s when you want to have one in surburban city “seven units per acre” neighborhoods and any “common wall” apartment/townhouse construction that I think government is entitled to have a conversation with you about your desire, given the capability of those types of weapons. In densely populated major urban centers only the police should have them… it’s strictly a question of proximity to neighbors and lethal capacity of the gun.

What Franklin actually said was, “They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.”  Keeping those words of “essentia” liberty and “temporary” safety makes a HUGE difference regarding his meaning.  Isn’t it amazing that so far I have NEVER seen any gun control opponent get that quote correct.  Hmmm, I wonder why that is.

BLOGOGRAPHER: “It’s when you want to have one in surburban city “seven units per acre” neighborhoods and any “common wall” apartment/townhouse construction that I think government is entitled to have a conversation with you about your desire, given the capability of those types of weapons. In densely populated major urban centers only the police should have them… it’s strictly a question of proximity to neighbors and lethal capacity of the gun.” – - – That was a superb point.

STAN “I’m not sure I want to give a police officer with a grade 10 education any ability to flag me as having shown up on his radar as a “possible” danger.” You and I are in complete agreement. The police are primarily functioning as the last-option-used muscle side of intervention, the identification process has to occur through better systems of identifying those people within day-to-day interactions with society, school, and work, and getting them face-to-face with qualified medical professionals.

BILL: “So, as you clamor to surround yourself and the society clamors to surround itself with more and more weapons to give them an illusion of security, their true liberty shrinks and shrinks further into nutty paranoia.” – - – OMG  That was superb also.  I can rarely pull off pithy comments that are that excellent.  I will be borrowing that in the future and will be providing the best attribution possible even though I won’t remember the name of the source.

Funny, all I see in the picture above are the notoriously Liberal, Connecticut white leftists “the beautiful people,” if you will  (never mind the Jews for preservation of firearm ownership–a very conservative group who would’ve preferred to have a firearm in-hand when approached by a Nazi officer) to be considered. 
Sorry, you’re outnumbered on this issue in Congress, pretty people. You seem to take your “moral high-ground” but forget that at least 1/2 of America opposes your viewpoint; Diane Fienstein has little chance of passing her bill in Congress because of her own lack of Democratic party support–and as for the NRA, never mind the them. The NRA is more worried about “grassroots” organizations like  “Jews for the preservation of Firearm Ownership” and “Michigan Open Carry,” along with other several other locally based organizations who don’t support the NRA.

“They were joined by politicians and some families of the Newtown victims.” – ABC News
How many is some?
What about coverage for the families who want some armed protection in the schools?
What about the families who don’t want the 2nd Amendment infringed upon?

The phrase “grade 10 education” is not one used in the United States. But it _is_ used in Canada. You’ve once again exposed yourself as a Canadian deceptively posing as an American. Americans don’t care what Canadians think. Keep out of our business.

Canada has absentee parents and busy parents, and video games and movies, but our per capita murder rate is three times higher and they don’t have anywhere near the frequency or intensity of mass murders.

Americans don’t care what Canadians think. You don’t even have freedom of speech in Canada.

Mr. President,
Please take your own advice and listen to this:
Connecticut already had an assault rifle ban but it did not prevent the Sandy Hook tragedy. Criminals, crazies and some gun enthusiasts like Adam’s mother, DON’T OBEY LAWS. 
Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. — Albert Einstein
The second Amendment is not about duck hunting.
It’s to protect “we the people” from you.
You abridged the 1st Amendment when you made Free Speech a felony – HR 347
You showed contempt for the 5th and 6th Amendments and the separation of powers when reaffirmed a provision that allows for indefinite detention without charge or trial after a federal judge had ruled that it was unconstitutional.
The criminal malfeasance of the federal government by getting us 16 trillion dollars in debt and no plan to balance the budget, much less pay off that debt, will inevitably result in a financial crash, food riots and martial law. It appears that that is what the federal government is preparing for.
You killed three American citizens without charge or trial. One of them was a 16 year old boy. Now you have authorized 30,000 drones you can use to control us. 
The Army has graduated the first class of “Internment/Resettlement” (concentration) camp guards.
The DHS has ordered over a BILLION hollow point bullets.
The police in our cities have been militarized and have been conducting joint exercises with the military.
Troops violated the 2nd and 4th Amendments when they confiscated guns (at gunpoint) from law abiding citizens in New Orleans, establishing a president.

There’s the big disaster cry again.  The GOP relishes impending crisis so they have an excuse to cut entitlements.
However the steps already taken have lowered our deficit trajectory significantly.

so NRA what should the Obama tell these families… sorry go home there is nothing I can do even though I am the President.  I don’t think so And don’t blame it on video games and TV Guns need stronger background check and restrictions




			Posted by: Tammy | January 27, 2013, 8:01 pm 8:01 pm		



Tammy, and what position did you have during Bush’s Patriot Act attempt?  According to your statements for stronger background checks and restrictions, you would have thought the Patriot Act was all the rave for giving us a little security.  Yet you defend Obama for doing what Bush tried with the Patriot Act.  You’ve been duped by the bamboozler in chief and the emotional hangover of a school tragedy who liberals will not let go of: after all isn’t Rahm Emmanuel’s statement of “don’t let a good crisis go to waste” all too true here?  Bush didn’t let 9/11 go to waste either with trying to pull the Patriot Act on us.  Yet depriving our freedoms for a little security is not the answer.
Meanwhile, what next? Ban football? . . . Obama is already pounding the war drums on that one:
“I have to tell you if I had a son, I’d have to think long and hard before I let him play football,” said Mr Obama.

The only thing Feinstein wants to do is stop the sale of evil assault weapons.   
I lost track of how many times she said that she wants to total disarm all American citizens.  We’re not supposed to remember that at all.   We aren’t supposed to remember that Sarah Brady’s first bunch was called “Handgun Control” who’s stated goal was the elimination of handguns.   Her next group wanted to get all guns.  The current Brady Bunch goal is the same as Feinstein’s stated goals:  Total firearm confiscation.  
We’re supposed to believe that the NRA gets all of their funding from gun makers.  We aren’t supposed to think about over 4 million dues paying members with more joining every hour.  
We’re aren’t supposed know that the Brady Bunch and other gun ban groups get most of their funding from Levi Strauss, oil giant George Soros and other billionaires and large corporations.   How many dues paying members does Brady have?   A thousand?  A hundred? A dozen? None? Nobody knows and they won’t say.   
We are many, they are few.   Their few have a lot of money.  That isn’t how a democracy is supposed to work.

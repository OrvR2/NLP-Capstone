You are right...My thought is to stop setting off fire works inside.﻿ That would end this type tragic accident.

Pyrotechnics in a﻿ tightly enclosed nightclub is NOT a good idea. The Station nightclub fire in 2003 in the US was also caused by pyrotechnics. You guys can youtube a raw video of the Station nightclub fire to see the stupidity of using fancy pyrotechnics in a enclosed area for yourselves. Having plenty of exits, lots of exit signs, strictly keeping to the people limit of the buildings, having lots of fire sprinklers, and not using pyrotechnics would have prevented this tragic incident.

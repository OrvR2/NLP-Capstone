PBS UK Launches On BSkyB, Virgin Media
By THE DEADLINE TEAM | Monday October 31, 2011 @ 10:34pm PDTTags: BSkyB, Ken Burns, PBS Distribution, Virgin Media 

The U.S. Public Broadcasting Service, long an importer of British fare, will attempt to return the favor starting Tuesday with the launch of PBS UK, the Wall Street Journal reports. The lineup includes U.S. flagship shows PBS News Hour and Frontline; the science series Nova; the U.S. version of Antiques Roadshow (format imported from Britain); and documentaries from director Ken Burns, whose Prohibition (pictured) will air on Day 1. It’s PBS’ first major foreign foray since the service was founded more than 40 years ago. PBS UK will air on Britain’s two biggest pay-TV platforms, British Sky Broadcasting and Virgin Media. It will be available to about 14 million viewers, roughly half the country’s TV audience. PBS is late to the party because it doesn’t have a lot of money. U.S. commercial networks such as MTV, Nickelodeon, Discovery and CBS have been in the UK for years. “The top priority is to get our content to an audience that I know is interested in the work we produce,” said PBS chief executive Paula Kerger.

Steven Spielberg’s ‘The Adventures Of Tintin’ To Close AFI Fest
By THE DEADLINE TEAM | Monday October 31, 2011 @ 4:08pm PDTTags: AFI Fest, American Film Institute, Steven Spielberg, The Adventures of Tintin 

Clint Eastwood’s ‘J. Edgar’ To World Premiere As AFI Fest Opener
LOS ANGELES, CA, October 31, 2011 – The American Film Institute (AFI) announced today that Paramount Pictures and Columbia Pictures’ THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN, directed by AFI Life Achievement Award recipient and Academy Award®-winning director Steven Spielberg, will have its North American Premiere as the Closing Night Gala of AFI FEST 2011 presented by Audi. The film is based on the internationally beloved and irrepressible characters created by Hergé and stars Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Nick Frost and Simon Pegg. It is produced by Academy Award® winners Spielberg, Peter Jackson and Kathleen Kennedy. From an original screenplay by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish, the story follows the unquenchably curious young reporter Tintin and his fiercely loyal dog Snowy as they discover a ship carrying an explosive secret that may hold the key to vast fortune…and an ancient curse. Academy Award®-winning composer John Williams scored the film, with 2011 marking a collaboration between Spielberg and Williams that has enriched 25 of their films together.

UPDATE: Stuntmen In ‘Expendables 2′ Fatal Accident Identified
By NELLIE ANDREEVA | Monday October 31, 2011 @ 4:00pm PDTTags: Bulgaria, Sylvester Stallone, The Expendables 2 

UPDATE, 4 PM: NuImage/Millennium Films released an update today on the accident that killed one stuntman and seriously injured another last week during filming on a 2nd Unit location for The Expendables 2 on Lake Ognyanovo, Bulgaria. Those men are now identified, and other information is clarified in the statement below.
“Our deepest condolences go to the family of Kun Lieu. His passing is  tragic.  Our sympathies also go to Nuo Sun who was seriously injured as a  result of the same explosion.  We have been informed his condition has  stabilized. He has been transported to Munich, Germany, where he is  receiving top medical care from the best specialists,” said Nu  Image/Millennium Films.
Regrettably, Bulgarian language newspapers have incorrectly reported  that stunt doubles for Jet Li and Sylvester Stallone were involved in  the accident.  This is absolutely false and inaccurate.  At the time of  the accident neither Li’s or Stallone’s stuntmen were on or near the  Second Unit set, nor were any of the film’s main actors, director Simon  West or any of the Main Unit crew.
Only Second Unit filming has been temporarily suspended and will resume  shortly. The filmmakers continue to work with authorities investigating  this accident. Main Unit production has not been interrupted and  continues as scheduled.

Sides Drawn In Fight Over New Piracy Bill
By THE DEADLINE TEAM | Monday October 31, 2011 @ 2:45pm PDTTags: MPAA, Stop Online Piracy Act 

Should The Feds Block Online Pirates? Lobbyists Intensify Debate Over New Bill
Congress’ mailboxes are filling up fast with letters from both sides of the fight over the Stop Online Piracy Act, which the House introduced last week. The legislation, which would empower the government to block overseas website that traffic in copyrighted content, is pitting content owners who want to protect their intellectual property against tech companies who fear the power granted to shut down sites would be too vast and could harm the Web economy. Today, the MPAA — whose chairman Chris Dodd urged support for the bill in an industry speech Wednesday — put out a statement touting the support for SOPA from the Fraternal Order of Police and the International Association of Fire Fighters, among other groups not usually associated with the entertainment industry. “The preparedness and safety of our members depend on sound, reliable  equipment,” FOP National President Chuck Canterbury said in his group’s letter to lawmakers. “Counterfeit  batteries, gloves, brake pads, and other equipment put us and the public  at risk.  Counterfeit pharmaceuticals, tooth paste, and footwear put  our seniors and our children at risk.  Organized gangs use these profits  from counterfeit DVDs to fund other criminal enterprises and fuel  violent crime in our communities here at home.”  Read More »

In 1919, after Boston police went on strike to protest the city's refusal to recognize their new union, Gov. Calvin Coolidge ordered the National Guard into the streets. 
Sam Gompers, the legendary father of American labor, wrote the governor that the Boston police had been denied their rights. 
Coolidge's terse reply put him in our history books: 
"Your assertion that the Commissioner was wrong cannot justify the wrong of leaving the city unguarded. ... There is no right to strike against the public safety by anyone, anywhere, any time." 
Ronald Reagan's firing of the striking air traffic controllers, whose union had been among the few to endorse him, marked him as a leader willing to act against a powerful union if the public interest commands it. 
Gov. Scott Walker is now in that tradition. He has just routed a recall campaign that began with state senators disgracefully fleeing to Illinois rather than provide a quorum and mobs occupying his capitol. 
Walter's victory is a fire bell in the night for the public-sector unions. It reflects a rising realization among all Western peoples that to continue accommodating the demands of government unions is to risk our survival as free and prosperous nations. 
The Badger State rout of Big Labor was total. 
The public-employee unions first capitulated to the governor's demand that they contribute more to their pensions and health care benefits. But they drew the line at Walker's determination to curtail collective bargaining and to cease deducting union dues from the paychecks of state workers. 
Collect your dues yourself, the governor was telling the unions. 
With their union dues no longer taken out of their paychecks, tens of thousands of Wisconsin public employees refused to pony up those dues and quit their union, instead. What does this tell us? 
Many union members do not believe they get their money's worth from unions that claim to represent them, and would prefer to get out of the union and keep the dues money themselves. 
This desertion by their members represents a massive vote of no confidence in unions like the America Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Teachers. AFSCME in Wisconsin lost 34,000 of its 62,000 members last year alone. 
From the Wisconsin experience, if right-to-work laws were enacted in every state, giving employees freedom to join or leave a union, public-employee unions would be abandoned, reduced to shadows of what they are today. What does it say about a union if its members would prefer not to belong, if they were free to leave? 
The curtailment of collective bargaining is the issue on which Walker appeared to be on the weakest ground, as school kids are taught that collective bargaining is a sacrosanct right. 
Yet here, too, the governor has a compelling argument. 
When union leaders put piles of cash into political campaigns, and union bosses then sit down to bargain with the people they have just put into office, who represents the public? 
Is there not an inherent conflict of interest when unions literally purchase with campaign contributions the election of officials with whom they are to negotiate the new contracts for their members? 
There are other reasons public-employee unions are losing public support. The pay and benefits of federal employees are twice that of the average private-sector worker, while the pay and benefits of state employees are half again as high. And government workers enjoy a job security few private-sector workers ever know. 
Unionized government workers are seen by almost no one as victims. Yet their numbers are huge.
Where there were twice as many Americans working in manufacturing as in government in 1960, today the reverse is true. We have 22 million workers in government and 11 million in manufacturing. 
This is an immense and costly army for taxpayers to sustain. 
Even Democrats, though they howl that we must milk the rich more, are starting to concede that the government sector, now at a peacetime record 37 percent of the gross domestic product, must be pared back. 
The salad days of the government employee are coming to an end, as they have already in Greece, Italy and Spain. 
As Europe went farther down that "road to socialism" than did we, the pain there will be greater. But it is coming here, too. 
Already, states and cities have begun cutting their labor force. And the states that were most indulgent in providing pay and benefits their taxpayers could not afford are the states being hit hardest, like Barack Obama's Illinois and Jerry Brown's California. 
The anger and accusations of union leaders, directed at Gov. Walker, testify to their shocked awareness of the new political realities. 
And Obama's conspicuous absence from the battlefield — he sent a tweet and did a flyover — testifies to his recognition that while government unions may be his loyal political allies, they are also an albatross hanging around his neck this November.

My grandpa founded a union for miners. AS long as it was a local union with no national affiliation the workers prospered.  When the national union stepped in the mine management was hurt and and the ability to keep the folks employed was reduced.  In 5 years the labor force went from over 30k to under 20k.  Yet during the same time the demand for metals was booming.  Just the cost was prohibitave.

Unions can play an important roll but not in the form they exist now.  No worker should be forced to give his hard earned money to any organization--or to belong to a group agains his will just to have the opportunity to have a job.  Right to Work is the right way--local unions can help but they MUST BE VOLUNTARY.

there's no place for a union when bleeding the taxpayers..  Wages should be based on the skills and education required to perform a job - period..  No union negotiations to over-compensate people and no holding the taxpayers hostage..

used to be that the govt jobs were for the people who could not make it in the private sector, the pay was less than a private sector counterpart but the benefits were better, enter the unions and that was turned upside down, I mean bus drivers making 100k per year would have made Ralph Cramden a socialite.

A "Tenured Teacher"
 that CAN't be fired EVER, 
or DELAYED forever with UNION rules,
because thats what NCLB or No Child Left Behind
really stands for, 
is so incredibly Un-DEMOCRATIC:

because that ranks  a JOB for life more IMPORTANT 
than
the QUALITY of YOUR  Children's Education !!!!

Crony organizations shouldn't be allowed to steal the labors of others in a nation based on liberty and freedom. Our government has become self serving at the expense of the people, the reason the economy and country is collapsing.

Unions used to work for their members. I think the teachers union president summed it all up with what unions are about today, and that was when he stated that " It isn't about the children, and never has been. You know it and I know it. It has always been about the fact that members were willing to pay us millions of dollars for our political power." And then when Joe Biden was the featured speaker at the AFL-CIO convention in Fla. in 2009, when he said," We won! We did it! Get on your dancing shoes boys, and get ready to dance!." 
And let's face it, with this president and his cronies in Congress, the unions have been dancing, alot. Not those members on the bottom rung of the ladder. They are usually the ones thrown to the wolves and take the decreases, increases and cuts, so that the higher ups or those with more political pull, get the rewards, better pay and better bennies. The unions also have those die hard members who believe everything their monthly paper/ union rep tells them. But I know alot of union members who see the truth. Most of them are cooks, laundry workers and custodians, and they all make less than $28,000 a yr, and pay the most for their bennies, so that the better pay and bennies can go to the nurses, police, firemen, etc. And when you have state gov'ts that cater to and reward the unions, it is the citizen taxpayers who pay the price. Look at Wa.state, we can't change our state gov't, or our Senators, because of Boeings members and their union. Most of our Senators have been joined at the hip with the unions, that the citizens don't stand a chance.  Between their members and their cozy elbow rubbing unions with our gov't, state and locally, there's so much power that the citizens can't get a break from them. And alot of us want changes, we just don't have enough power or votes, so we are stuck. If you live in a right to work state or have a state gov't willing to stand up to the unions AND their bellyaching members who don't want to pay what the rest of us pay for our benefits, hang on to them and stand with them. Otherwise, it may not be right away, but sooner or later, you will regret that you EVER let them get a hold over your state or your state/local gov't. And we all know how much the Dems love to remove your money so that they can spend it on what THEY choose to spend it on. Or they remove it from you, and use it against you.

Looking at the history of labor unions, I've come to these conclusions. When they are first formed, it's usually due to a justified complaint of management being ruthless over employees, and those employees organize to protect themselves from unfair labor practices. But as the years roll by, things change, and unions get cocky about their power, and demand more and more until THEY become the overbearing factor, and THEIR demands become dictatorial. Then the pendulum swings the other way. That is the situation we are seeing today.

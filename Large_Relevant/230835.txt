James Carville: Rick Perry Is The Worst Presidential Candidate In American History

Rick Perry‘s devastating fifth-place finish in the Iowa caucus, despite his early buzz and spending the most money in the state, prompted CNN political commentator James Carville to call his campaign the worst in American history. “Rick Perry is the worst presidential campaign, candidate in American history,” Carville boldly declared, spurring loud disagreement with his fellow panelists. 
“In American history?” an incredulous Anderson Cooper exclaimed.

Roland Martin suggested Fred Thompson and Rudy Giuliani were worse, but Carville stood his ground.  
“Who is worse? He was on fire. He was on fire for a while. There’s nobody that had worse debates than he did. There was nobody that raised more money to less effect,” Carville explained. “Not Giuliani, not Fred Thompson, not John Connally, not anybody — given the expectations of where he started… I’m sorry, he was the worst ever.”
Martin compared the candidates to star college football players who disappointed in the NFL.
“Rick Perry is Ryan Leaf. Rudy Giuliani is certainly JaMarcus Russell,” Martin said.
Carville surmised the audience wouldn’t know what he was talking about.

Rick Perry is probably the worst American in history, much less Presidential candidate.  What’s with the deep fissures all over his ugly mug?  He’s hiding some horrible secrets in there, no doubt.  It’ll be hilarious to see how hamstrung in TX he’ll be now.  The illusion of Rick’s minimal competence has been utterly shattered.

Perry is the one who got abducted by aliens; illegal ones.  When he said his “don’t have a heart” pratfall line, he dropped like Texas cow pie.  He should have just said he’d “slit all their throats and dance in their blood”.  It would have made him the darling of the GOP.

Then what’s Obama make Perry look like?
Facts are, when the economy was bleeding jobs, Texas was creating them using the exact opposite policies of Obama.  So, the implication is that Obama’s smart.  So, truly, how smart do you have to be to do this bad?

Just because Carville, who makes a living spewing out hot air, say so doesn’t make it so.  Nonetheless, Perry, as we all found out once he left Texass (if you were paying attention), is one pretty pathetic candidate.  But the bigger question is how this ultimate Texassan pay to play politician has gotten re-elected so many times in Texass (with my regards to Austin).  And on a side note… How bout them Cowboys!?

I doubt that it James. However, I recall seeing and listening to Perry before he announced on his book tour. Perry was really impressive, had swagger and looked larger than life. But, after he had his debate debacles, no matter that he rebounded somewhat, he really looked small after that. I don’t think after those moments Perry even wanted to stick around, but he wasn’t a quitter like, lets say Palin. I don’t think Perry even wanted to run, but when the right wing of the party couldn’t find a their brand of a conservative, they pressured Perry into getting into the race.

Sorry, James. Perry has been a pretty awful candidate but only one Presidential candidate, as I can remember, had their hopes dashed when they could not even come up with a coherent answer for the question, “why do you want to be President?” ….. That candidate was Ted Kennedy. That moment stands up to just about any of Rick Perry’s “brain farts.”

Actually, that one’s quite easy.  Here’s something that went full detail on it 
http://www.politicalmathblog.com/?p=1590
But if that’s too much, a more condensed explanation: their population has absolutely exploded compared to any other state because of other people looking for work.  Had they not come, the unemployment rate would be closer to 2.3% at the time of it.

If by ‘creating jobs’ you mean leading the nation in the growth of jobs that pay minimum wage with no benefits while also siphoning jobs away from neighboring states, you’d be right.

Carville’s analysis reminds me of the old movies where the U-boat captain surfaces and machine-guns the survivors in the water.






WiddleBabyDanielson



OOPS…
Of jobs created in Texas since 2007, 81 percent were taken by newly arrived immigrant workers (legal and illegal).
In terms of numbers, between the second quarter of 2007, right
before the recession began, and the second quarter of 2011, total
employment in Texas increased by 279,000. Of this, 225,000 jobs went to
immigrants (legal and illegal) who arrived in the United States in 2007
or later.
Of newly arrived immigrants who took a job in Texas, 93 percent were
 not U.S. citizens. Thus government data show that more than
three-fourths of net job growth in Texas were taken by newly arrived
non-citizens (legal and illegal).
The large share of job growth that went to immigrants is surprising
because the native-born accounted for 69 percent of the growth in Texas’
 working-age population (16 to 65). Thus, even though natives made up
most of the growth in potential workers, most of the job growth went to
immigrants.
The share of working-age natives holding a job in Texas declined
significantly, from 71 percent in 2007 to 67 percent in 2011. This
decline is very similar to the decline for natives in the United States
as a whole and is an indication that the situation for native-born
workers in Texas is very similar to the overall situation in the country
 despite the state’s job growth.
Of newly arrived immigrants who took jobs in Texas since 2007, we
estimate that 50 percent (113,000) were illegal immigrants. Thus, about
40 percent of all the job growth in Texas since 2007 went to newly
arrived illegal immigrants and 40 percent went to newly arrived legal
immigrants.
Immigrants took jobs across the educational distribution. More than
one out three (97,000) of newly arrived immigrants who took a job had at
 least some college.

OOPS…
The CIS report, which is based on Current Population Survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau, uses two distinct methodologies to measure how much of the state’s job growth went to immigrants between mid-2007 and mid-2011.The first methodology compares the net employment increase with the number of newly arrived immigrants holding a job. By that yardstick, newly arrived immigrants accounted for 29 percent of the growth in Texas’ working age population (ages 16 to 65) between mid-2007 and mid-2011. But they accounted for about 81 percent of the overall increase in employment.The second methodology compares the net increase in employment with the net increase in immigrant employment. According to that measure, the increase in the number of working-age immigrants accounted for 31 percent of the increase in the state’s overall working-age population between mid-2007 to mid-2011. But they accounted for about 54 percent of employment growth.Pia Orrenius, an economist and immigration expert at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, called the first methodology “misleading.”“You’re comparing gross inflows to net job creation,” she said. “You have to compare net to net.”Orrenius said the second methodology was more reliable. As for finding that immigrants accounted for about half the employment increase, that’s “typical for the nation” she said.http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2011/09/study-pins-much-of-texas-job-g.html OOPS…Using CIS’ methodology for counting the impact of immigration on jobs it might be said that immigrants were responsible for 169 percent of net business creation in Texas in 2007 and 2008.Lastly, the CIS study notes that Texas’ current unemployment rate isn’t much better than the national average. However, it is important to point out that Texas has received an inflow of 781,542 domestic job seekers and their families in the past 10 years, with that number accelerating more recently. This has acted to inflate the unemployment rate in Texas. On the other end of the ledger, Americans moving to Texas in search of a better life have acted to reduce the unemployment rate of states such as New York and Massachusetts where 1,570,310 and 328,695 people, respectively, have moved out. This latter point has been largely ignored in the national debate about the impact on jobs that policies on taxes, regulations and the legal climate have.http://www.texaspolicy.com/pdf/2011-10-PB45-TexasModel-WhoReallyGetsTexasJobs-CFP-ChuckDeVore.pdf

I know.  During the war there were many Hollywood movies like Action in the North Atlantic that were basically propaganda.  The U-boat captains are heartless murderers, blah blah blah.  There is even a cool British film from that era that shows a sailor shooting the anti-aircraft gun up to the moment where the waves cover the sinking ship.






david r



 You’ve given him the cruelest cut of all.  In Texas, if you can’t be the best, you can only take pride in being the absolute worst.  Viz., 2005 Astros vs. Chicago White Sox.  Astros were the worst Series team ever. (Swelling with pride.)

“So, you were unable to read this

Could have gone without you implying illiteracy on my part but hey, to each their own.  If you want to act like a snarky troll, so be it.
This data set shows incomplete information.  Or, at the least, the website presenting it (politicalmathblog) is doing so dishonestly.  The thing about averages is that they are incredibly sensitive to extreme outliers, i.e: millionaires and billionaires.    
Wage statistics take into account the wages of everyone.  This includes the highest wage earners.  As such, a large increase in the number of people making millions a year can jerk that average up.  Interestingly enough, that’s exactly what happened in Texas.  
http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/blog/2010/09/millionaires_in_texas_-_who_knew.html
“Texas moved up two spots, to 26th, on a list ranking states based on
the percentage of millionaire households, gaining nearly 35,000
millionaires in the process.  Despite its mid-pack ranking, in raw numbers Texas has the third-most
 millionaires of any state, with 381,165. Texas’ wealth-mongers are
nipping at the heels of New York, where 381,197 rich residents reside.”
Where did these millionaires come from?  Parsimoniously, one would have to assume that they moved from other states, considering that the idea of 35,000 people within the state of Texas alone being able to become millionaires during the worst economic conditions in almost a century is incredibly improbable.

“Despite its mid-pack ranking, in raw numbers Texas has the third-most millionaires of any state, with 381,165. Texas’ wealth-mongers are nipping at the heels of New York, where 381,197 rich residents reside.”"
This, by the way, is the most important sentence in the article.  If Texas has the 3rd most millionaires, why are they so small a percentage of the population that it pushes the state down to 26th?  It could be two things: 
1. Texas has a massive population.  However, so do California and New York, yet they rank higher than Texas in percentage of millionaires.
2.  There is significant income inequality in Texas.  However, it’s important to note that this metric only measures percentage of millionaires, it does not measure the percentage of people making minimum wage and above.

For the article you post to be true, then you or the writer has to show that there are jobs waiting for these people – they just haven’t gotten them yet.  Where does it show the disconnect between the employment rate and jobs?  For your post to mean something, it must show that jobs are out there – the 8.2% unemployed just haven’t found them…






Anonymous



First off, sorry, I assumed you saw it and just ignored it.  Anyways…
One of the problems I have is that while Texas has the third largest amount of millionaires, they also have a much larger population compared to other states.  So, they would need to make exponentially more to spread out even more which is why they’re still at 26.  Additionally, a lot of the top 10 states with the highest percentage of millionaires still increased a lot.
But I will concede at least one of the points you’re making, if not inadvertently: Texas is attracting business in a big way.  The CEO of CKE Restaurants, Carl’s Jr and Hardee’s among others, stated that he purposefully chose to build I think it was, 1,000 restaurants in Texas over the next few years because the business climate in Texas is so much better than, say, California where they are not expanding.

“One

 of millionaires, they also have a much larger population compared to
other states.  So, they would need to make exponentially more to spread
out even more which is why they’re still at 26.”  
This is a point that I address in a follow up comment earlier.  I’m sure you’re seeing it now.  Ultimately, my point is that a cursory glance at wage averages does not give us any indication of WHY Texas has an average wage of $15 and HOW it happened.  As such, I was particularly taken aback by how quickly the author of Political Math was willing to extrapolate a conclusion with such little actual data.  I don’t know him well enough to accurately assume that he did so because the conclusion fit his narrative, but that seems like the case considering that he seems to have a great grasp at interpreting statistics otherwise.
“But I will concede at least one of the points you’re

Yep.  Texas is attracting businesses.  That’s not really new news.  And yes, it is largely due to the extremely lax regulations and lack of a state income tax.

You’re*  lol
Anyways, of course, it’s an absurd argument, but if we’re looking at who’s curious or not.  Let’s look at Obama.  He believes he knows what’s right, end of story.  Disagree with him?  You clearly don’t want what’s best for this country.  Think something needs to be reconsidered?  You’re probably a racist.  He left his inquisitive mind at communist day camp.  Run a business and think you know how to spend you’re money better than Obama?  Clearly, you’re unpatriotic.  None of that has been working, but still, Obama’s right.
Rick Perry, on the other hand, seems to have a more hands off approach letting people do what they will with their money and that seems to be working in Texas.

“You’re*  lol”
–Of course…my error.
 “He believes he knows what’s right, end of story.  Disagree with him?  You clearly don’t want what’s best for this country.  Think something needs to be reconsidered?”
–Obama blends ideological certainty with logistical flex.  IMHO every good leader has a core that is solid yet is open minded to the ways in which goals are achieved.
“You’re probably a racist.”
–He calls folk’s racist?  I have not seen that despite the fact that he has been the focus of racist hate.
“Run a business and think you know how to spend you’re money better than Obama?  Clearly, you’re unpatriotic.”
–Is this just your summary?  I have never heard him declare this.  Examples that inform your perspective?
 “None of that has been working, but still, Obama’s right.”
It has been working.  The economy is on the mend.  This idea that the economy is horrible is unsupported.
Rick Parry is very hands off… in part a matter of personality but largely as consequence of different structural opportunities available to a Texas vs. federal executive.

There are a few others I have in mind, don’t know if any qualify as the worst.
The Howard Dean scream?
Helmet wearing Michael Dukakis touring on tank?
Hillary dodging bullets on 1996 trip to Bosnia and New Hampshire sympathy cry?
Sweaty, stubbled Nixon on TV debating Kennedy?

If you listen closely he is referring to how the campaign imploded so the comments have some legitimacy.  
Although using this barometer the same could be said about Newt down the road depending on how much more he implodes.

Yeah, king of the minimum wage jobs; biggest polluting state; highest rate of uninsured health care,,, used Fed. stimulus money to balance last two state budgets.
Texas would have been the perfect model for creating a third world nation if it had seceded.  But it needs the Federal Government.  Rick was always full of shit… like you.

Not to mention ignorant.  Seriously, do think we can even begin to have any kind of intelligent discourse with people carrying on about Obama’s birth certificate and his qualifications to get into Harvard?  These people don’t think… they react to their puppeteers pulling their strings… also known as manipulators.

LOL!….
Yet you have your fruitcake utopia in California…less than half the size of Texas, emmitting almost 85% of the pollutants the texas emits…and has a budget deficit twice the size of texas.
As for minimum wage jobs, would you prefer that everyone remain on 11.5% unemployment like in the golden state?
And check out LA if you want to see a standard bearer for a third world country….As usual for most libs…your ideological blinders keep you from realizing that it’s your own shit, that’s stinking up the place

Why are so many of you going after James Carville?  He’s simply telling the truth: Perry’s campaign has been a Three Stooges movie since its beginning, right down to the lead character.  That’s not Carville’s fault.  And Carville’s got some credibility on these matters, having run a successful presidential campaign himself some years back.  
Republicans just don’t ever want to admit there’s a clown in their midst.  If they did, then they’d have to admit that there are others, besides, . . . like, oh, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Sarah Palin, the fabulous Donald Trump, Allen West, to name just a few.
The larger issue here seems to be, Why are Republican voters so attracted to clowns?

I don’t incorporate “smug” into my screen name, acting like it is a  parody when it is the truth. Truth has a way of working itself out, and your pal is honest about his manifold shortcomings. I am hardly a troll, compared to a two bit by the numbers contard type like A_smug_self_righteous_dittohead






Walt



LOL!…
Yes, we should all aspire like you backwards conservatives do with your race to the bottom ideology allowing the 1% to rule over you with fear and religious dogma (that’s a far cry from the social justice I learned from Christianity) just like back in Colonial times.
California has their obstructionist republicons, as well, who won’t allow a budget to pass w/o 2/3 majority which means they won’t allow the wealthy to pay their fair share.  Ironically, California was doing just fine until Reagan became governor which ironically is what also happened to the rest of the country when Reagan became president and did all that spending and tax cuts.  And then the country moved right and now we have you right wing extremists being the voice of reason on the right.  Truly backwards.
Obviously, you are not up on the fact that CA has some of the highest EPA standards with the CEPA standards often more stringent than the Fed.
The truth is with both political sides embracing Friedmanomics and turning away from Keynesian economics over the last 30 years it is you, your smugness, and your ideology which has done so much damage to the prosperity of this country adding that you have even gotten more crazier thanks to your propaganda media machine led by the coward and charlatan Rush Limbaugh.  But there is a shift that is going on because people are truly fed up with your kind of ignorance that has been screaming the loudest for too long.  You can have the last word as if will mean anything.

I guess you missed the news story that Perry’s job numbers were more smoke than fire.  I think he was saying something like 1 million jobs when the actual number was less than 100,000 and few of them sustaining jobs with enough income to support a family.  You also forget that Clinton left Bush a well-tuned, beautifully maintained Lamborghini to drive.  When Obama arrived, Bush left HIM a broken down old Miata with flat tires and a blown engine.  Expecting Obama to repair the car and turn it around for a victory lap was kind of crazy, don’t you think?  If Bush had left a surplus similar to what he inherited, as well as a war-free military, good international relations, low inflation and $0.99 gas for consumers and businesses, it would have been a very different story.  Instead, more than a trillion dollars had fled up and out of the economy – thanks to those old regulation-hating boys – and a seriously disrupted global economy. Tell me again why anyone with half a brain would ever vote for a Republican again in their lifetime?  Or do you also invite bank robbers and muggers to your house for a stay?

Nobody, (Dodd’s immediate family included, I’d bet) seriously thought that Chris Dodd would be President. Where was the spectacle? Where were these groups lobbying for Dodd to jump in the race?  Dodd never polled more than 1% nationally in that race.
 Rick Perry?  Different case altogether. This guy was LEADING THE POLLS. Then those debates happened….

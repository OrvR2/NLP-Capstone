Who's a Coward?Mona Charen's column is released once a week. By Mona Charen | Mona Charen – Fri, Jan 18, 2013

Who said this about a world leader: He's a "political coward — an essentially unchallenged leader who nevertheless is unwilling to lead or spend political capital to advance the cause of compromise"? Was it perhaps John Boehner describing Barack Obama? No, though the shoe would certainly fit. It was Barack Obama describing Binyamin Netanyahu. 
This insight into Obama's views comes from an interview with the Atlantic Magazine's Jeffrey Goldberg. Let's pause for second to consider the gall. Mr. Obama knows full well that the United States confronts an unavoidable debt crisis if our government does not reform entitlements. Rather than lead, Obama has peddled denial ("We don't have a spending problem"), distortion (suggesting that Republicans who want spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling are "not paying America's bills") and demonization of the rich. 
What wouldn't Netanyahu give for such manageable problems? 
The prime minister of Israel is confronted by deadly threats in all directions. Iran, whose leaders routinely threaten to destroy the Jewish state (the "moderate" Hashemi Rafsanjani noted that "one bomb" would destroy all of Israel so "it is not irrational to contemplate such an eventuality"), is marching, seemingly inexorably with Obama's reelection, toward a nuclear weapon. 
Syria is in flames, with the outcome uncertain. Lebanon is controlled by Hezbollah. Iraq's future stability is in doubt with the total withdrawal of U.S. forces.
Egypt, whose three-decade peace treaty with Israel offered a certain tenuous security to the Jewish state, is now in the hands of the Muslim Brotherhood. And while Obama's Director of National Intelligence James Clapper described the Brotherhood in 2011 as "largely secular," the true nature of the regime is dawning on even the most obtuse. There was Mohammed Morsi's power grab in late November, when he attempted to grant himself sweeping authority. There is the persecution of Christians at the hands of the Muslim Brotherhood (sometimes including crucifixion). And there is the 2010 video that surfaced recently of Morsi himself describing Israelis as bloodsuckers, warmongers and "the descendants of apes and pigs."
According to Goldberg, Obama has said repeatedly, "Israel doesn't know what its best interests are." With each new settlement announcement, Obama believes,  "Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation."
Obama is revealing his ignorance and arrogance. The question of settlements has not prevented the Palestinians from negotiating in the past. The PA decided to make halting settlements a condition of negotiation after Obama himself insisted upon it. They could hardly do less. By big-footing it, Obama impeded the cause of negotiations.
Israel has built most settlements in regions quite close to the 1967 borders that everyone believes would be incorporated into Israel anyway. As the Washington Post noted in an editorial implicitly critical of Obama, "80 percent of [Israeli settlers] could be included in Israel if the country annexed just more than 4 percent of the West Bank — less than the 5 percent proposed by President Bill Clinton 12 years ago." Obama himself has predicted that there would be "land swaps" as part of any final agreement. Besides, why is it considered out of the question that some Jewish settlements would remain in a future Palestinian state? There are more than a million Israeli Arabs living throughout the Jewish state.
Has Mr. Obama not considered that Israel has dismantled settlements in the Sinai and Gaza? The Gaza withdrawal brought not peace but unrelenting missile fire. The jury is out on the Sinai withdrawal.
Like his colleagues on the left, and like his nominee for Defense Secretary, Obama believes that Israel's vulnerability is her own fault. He utterly misconceives the entire conflict, which is not about "two states for two peoples" (which Israel has repeatedly endorsed and sacrificed for) but about the stubborn Palestinian rejection of Israel's existence. Evidence for this is so abundant — from official PA maps that show no Israel, to Palestinian TV programs that laud terrorists as heroes, to a recent poll showing that 56 percent of Palestinians oppose a two-state solution — that ignorance cannot be explained as benign. Just in the past week, Mahmoud Abbas decided not to accept hundreds of thousands of Syrian Palestinian refugees into the land he controls because Israel asked that they sign a waiver renouncing a "right of return" to the Jewish state. He was explicit: It's "better they die in Syria than give up their right of return." 
That's what Israel must contend with. Perhaps worst of all is the tacit hostility of Israel's formerly most steadfast friend.

I listened to the President of the United States this morning, Moan, and I heard great leadership and courage I hope you were listening.  I hope you will spend some time reading his words and turn your attention to the United States of America.  Mr Netanyahu is considered a corrupt politician and not worthy of any of our time.

typical lib response....if you don't like what someone says, they must be a racist. THAT is out of date and stupid.

I called you Joan because you didn't have sense to spell Mona's name correctly.

If you think he had a great message yesterday, you have to be one of the low information (gullible) voters that Obysmal gave such an effective snowjob to during the election season. 

Calling Netanyahu corrupt without the skepticism of what Obysmal has done for the last 4 years is the essence of a kool-aid drinker.

Have a great life, Gene!

Every President for the past 60 or so years has attempted to solve the Israeli-Palestinian problems. None has succeeded. Were they all fools and cowards? I doubt it. And I don't think any of our efforts have made the situation worse. The parties themselves do a fine job of that on their own, without any assistance from us. No outsider will solve the problem. Outsiders may be able to bring the leaders to the table, but it's up to them to craft agreements they can live with. Placing blame is easy for armchair diplomats, but it's unproductive, unless your sole reason is to find fault and not to shed light on the real problems. The problem will not be resolved by decree or UN resolutions or columnists with agendas. And it is unlikely to be peacefully resolved by the current leaders in Israel and the Palestinian territories. A more likely scenario is another 60 years of conflict and fruitless negotiations in the area. That's the reality, no matter what any U.S. President says or does!

I was wondering when Mona would get back to her real agenda, Israel.  Yes, I agree Puffin it is President Obama, Moan, and just you remember that.  Sunday and Monday are happy days for America and let us celebrate our democracy and our honest election.  Mr. Netanya hu bet on the wrong horse and so did Mona.

It's not Mr. Obama, its PRESIDENT Obama.  Learn your loyalties woman, whether you like him or not; he is accorded the respect due to the OFFICE.  He was voted in fairly, legally, and morally.  You do not insult the Office by referring to its current occupant as Mister.

"The PA decided to make halting settlements a condition of negotiation after Obama himself insisted upon it."

Yes, because that was never a condition that Condi/W also insisted upon, right?  

Maybe Mona forgot that PM Olmert shook Condi's hand in 2006 and promised no new settlements, and before her plane left the tarmac at Tel Aviv, Olmert had already stabbed the W Admin in the back and went ahead to approve new settlements.

That is the problem with the Israeli govt.  They demand that the US back them, but when we do and set our own conditions to continue working with them, they stab us in the back the first opportunity that they get.

I'm glad Obama is telling them to stuff it.  While he's at it, time to cut off the foreign aid.

Mona has written another complaint about Obama as though he is supposed to calm the waters in the Middle East.  Just in case Mona doesn't get it, Israel is not a part of the U.S., and is not our responsibility.

To start off her invective, Mona mentioned "unavoidable debt crisis," "denial," "distortion," and "demonization," all of which have nothing to do with the Middle East.  It might serve her well if she took another class in writing.

buildingEXODUS V4.0 simulation of the Rhode Island nightclub fire. The fire conditions are predicted using SMARTFIRE V4.1. The simulation predicts evacuation through available doors and windows. A number of people perish in this simulation due to the rapidly developing fire.  The colour coding of the people indicates the response time band for the occupants.  The people coloured red reacted most rapidly, they are on the dance floor.  The colour of the floor is an indication of the smoke concentration at head height.  The darker the colour, the thicker the smoke at head height.  Finally, the body markings on the floor represents where we predict a fatality occured - The animation was generated in 2008

We had an sad example﻿ yesterday nearbythe city I live, the burning of Kiss Club left more than 200 people dead or injuried. Agregate, dense smoke, 1,500 people and only one exit with narrow 2,00 meters.

The Kiss nightclub disaster is very similar to the Station Nightclub disaster. Similar problems with regards to﻿ the use of fireworks, PU foam soundproofing, limited exit availability and large numbers of people. You may be interested to read my blog on the Kiss tragedy, you can find a link to this on the FSEG home page fseg.gre.ac.uk

Danilo. I have been studying the Station Fire and the Kiss fire and I strongly believe that there was nowhere near 1500 people at the Kiss club. More like 800. There is no way over 1000 would have﻿ escaped at Kiss w 1 door only. There are 400 victims dead and hurt at Kiss..I believe 400 got out unhurt. But now way another 700 would have made it out. Do the math.

It is not clear how wide the exit is. If the exit was 2m wide, then assuming﻿ people were queued up at the exit, it would take 400 people about 2.5 min to get out in an orderly manner while 1000 people would take 6 min. In the Station fire, you had about 100 sec or 1.7 min to get out before conditions became non-survivable. If the victims in Kiss had 100 s, then 266 people would have got out. Considering the victims, that makes about 520 in the club .at the time of the fire.

It now looks like the final exit is 3m wide. For this exit, 400 people could exit in 100 sec, 1000 people could exit in 250 sec. If the victims in Kiss has 100 s, then about 635 people may have been in the club. If the victims in Kiss had 250 s to get out, then there may have been about 1235 people in the club at﻿ thte time. It depends on what the available safe egress time (ASET) is.

By trying to reproduce actual events we can identify potential problems with our models and improve them. By improving our models, they become better design tools enabling engineers to design safer structures and hopefully preventing similar disasters from happening in the future. Real world incidents, provide us with important insight into real human behaviours that we﻿ cannot ever hope to reproduce in an experiment. So some good can come out of these tragedies.

Yes, this is a difficulty in many night clubs. By their very nature they are dark places, with dim lighting. In many cases the signage is poor - detracts from the ambience in the eyes of the operators - and the exits are usually poorly lit.﻿ In some cases the emergency exits may even be locked due to "security" issues. Whenever you go to such public venues, you should always scope out the place and make sure you know where the emergency exits are, and that they work!

The different colours represent occupants with differences in a simulation parameter called the Response Time. This is the time﻿ required for people to react and start their evacuation. The people (agents) with the same colour have response times in the same range of response times. The response time ranges used in the simualation was derived from video of the incident, survivor accounts and engineering judgement.

Could you explain me the difference between the white, yellow and red people at the beginning of﻿ the simulation?
Thank you :)

Thanks for the﻿ reply. I see your point that it would be difficult to duplicate things exactly. It is chilling to watch, but maybe that's why we need to watch it.

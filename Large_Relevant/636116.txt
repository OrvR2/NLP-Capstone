Alex Jones is not a hero, he trying to start a revolution. Revolutions are bad because you never know what will come of it, they are almost always controlled by the opposition! Alex jones (controlled half truther) on p Morgan (scumbag) is just showbiz, and will divide this country even more. If Eric Jones had anything important to say, he wouldn't be alive today. In my opinion, Alex just made us constitutionalists look like a bunch of kook psycho-paths

Snoop Lion
The name Calvin Broadus, (formerly "Snoop Dogg") gave himself﻿ after smoking so much hardcore dank jamaican kush while simultaneously listening to Bob Marley that he had some kind of weed-enduced epiphany where he came to believe that he actually was Bob Marley.

Yeah, every﻿ reggae artist outside of Jamaica must be fake because reggae was invented in Jamaica. Sure. That's why there are no non-norwegian black metal bands either, or non-american rock bands. Get the fuck out of the internet.

That's not really true.﻿ If (not referring to anyone) someone makes terrible music that takes him no time at all to write and record, but gets total acceptance by everyone who hears it, he doesn't deserve it. He wouldn't be an 'artist'.

I think that its awesome that some1 like Snoop Dogg is trying to help stop all the negativity, if you took time to watch/read he has explained in some of the interviews that he was﻿ getting tired of burying his friends,how the rap industry has lost so many talented﻿ ppl because of the division between the coasts and how many fans are looking up to them and following down the same path.It's all about the evolution from snoop dogg to snoop lion, btw I have been a fan for past the 15 years.

I love how when an artist ages, and changes﻿ their beliefs and life style, their "fans" immediately disrespect them. If you don't like his new stuff, don't listen to it. Listen to the stuff you do like, and respect the artist, let them be who they are.

I haven't liked what he has been putting out for a while. Always respect him﻿ for what he did for Rap and never disrespected for what he has been doing but this is to much. I believe this is an act and he will be back to rap in no time. Next, you will posting comments on how he had an adventure and telling everyone not to hate that he tried a different style of music.

"If you don't like his new stuff don't listen to it" that's like saying "If you don't like someone's comment don't read it." How are you supposed to know if you like something or not until your try it? Also if somebody doesn't like something just the very fact that something exist is a nuisance. First off﻿ it's taking up space for thing the person does like, second that person is bound to have encounters with that something every now and than, so it's natural that person expresses contempt for it

Man if youre crazy about Grunge or Punk or some different Kind of Music, youll sure imitate the﻿ Stars if the Genrè.
Like for Westside Rap, youll imitate and spell the "i" like an "a" and so on. So why cant Rappers be mad about reggae and because the like it imitate their Idols (Bob Marley)?
Stars are Humans too and they cant changfe their Style and Point of view as much as you can.
And dont forget that he is 40! You cant rap about beeing Gangsta for eternity while having millions, accept it!

this is like a joke.. he sounds like shit when singing reggae.. Snoop DOGG is always a westcoast gangster RAPPER.. this Snoop Lion bullshit﻿ with reggae is just to make more money because Snoop DOGG loves his dough.
i won't listen to any of this.. Deep Cover is true Snoop DOGG.

I've always been a Bob Marley fan and I'm not trying to compare these two but maybe with Snoop Lion changing to reggae, more people may be interested in listening to the genre and appreciate it a little bit more just like when I listened to Bob. I now love reggae because it just﻿ takes that one artist to make you appreciate a certain genre.

Maybe his fake accent is like Marshal Mather's﻿ Slim Shady? It's just an alter ego and another conduit for self expression. Let him be.

To those who are complaining over his accent: If any artist (singers, actors etc.)﻿ from foreign countries would start talking in their original accent, it would probably annoy you. They usually try to talk in American accent, because that's where their money is. Snoop Lion is simply changing his style to get to more people, especially those in Latin America.
No need to be hating because of his new style.

So it's alright to change your accent to American and you are not foolish, but when you change your American accent to Jamaican (or perhaps some other accent, doesn't matter right now) then it's wrong and foolish?
If people do not like his new style, then they should just﻿ go back to listen to his old songs.
I think his new and old style is good, so I'm just gonna enjoy the ride.

It's foolish when anyone changes their accent, I never said anything to the contrary. It's just very laughable that someone so well known would decide to talk differently after so many years in﻿ the public spotlight. No different than Madonna pretending she's British.

Race don't scientifically exist,﻿ chief. All you're doing is creating a social construction based on something you attribute you some kind of value on miniscule things like phenotypes (Physical Traits) Ancestry, melanin in the skin.
There are only one type of Humans on this planet. Homo-Sapiens-Sapiens. Homo (human) neanderthalas was a competitor with Homo-Sapiens and we beat then. We are all one race.

i like what Snoops tryin to do here. Unfortunately, he doesnt have the greatest singing voice, or maybe its just the producer that didnt make the vocals clear. IMO If Snoops gonna make serious music he may have to use autotune﻿ or something. Still needs work.

Why the need to try and be an artist that you are not. The fake rasta accent sounds rediculous, you were born in LA not Jamaica.
Snoop, go back﻿ to what you do best and do another rap album.

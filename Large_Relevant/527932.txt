I am on Russia and China's side and Iran's. They are the last countries  to defend humanity against Fascism which has inflicted the United States, Canada, Britain and many parts of Europe. People say they are fighting for freedom yet they are actually fighting for Fascism. The word Fascism has been replaced by freedom today. 

If the United States citizens take back their government you will see an actual real freedom fighting revolution across the world.

Fluoride was found by Nazi scientists that it caused infertility, cancers, shuts off parts of the brain which include emotions, thinking abilities, thoughts, normal human responses, and etc. It also causes your teeth to rot. It destroys your bones and causes arthritis and many other things. 

I could go on but it would be a long note to publish on here.  But the simple statement is the "Nazi's did it first." Why would future countries do it to?

Is that your response? Do you follow history? Are you a cop ordered to put propaganda on the internet and so forth or any corporation or institution or company?

I have been in the army and Canada is right behind the fascist goals and agendas that are based within the United States. The events in history that outlined this takeover come right from operation paperclip and the start of the Federal Reserve private bank. Those two events wrote the end of the United States.

A real gangster steals your money in a bank. And they own the bank. 

A real gangster wears a tie and a top hat and has a tommy gun. 

A real gangster owns stores and gets protection money from people they threaten. Like modern day police. 

This modern "gangster" crap is just some wild baby stuff compared to a real "gangster". :|

Its not the best example of what the person said it did like the moon landing was reincarnated but I got his reference. And it totally makes a lot of sense. Reincarnated would simply imply it was done somewhere else. Thats all.

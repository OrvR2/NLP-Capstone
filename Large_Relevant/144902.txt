Because I love my country, The United States of America, I can in no true, honest, integritable, or American Patritic way support or appreciate this man's agenda. That being said, I do, and I will always support the office of the President of United States of America! I will also always support the man﻿ in that office in his sworn duties!

Now that the tables have turned in your favor. You're telling me to practice what you yourself NEVER even considered practicing under Bush. Which is to support﻿ him. I do very much support the office that President Obama holds, but not for one second do I have to respect a man who swore in oath TWICE NOW to uphold and defend the Constitution when his actions clearly speak against it.

Tired of hearing the debt myth. The debt went up from 11 to 16 trillion so not all the previous presidents combined. And can you name one policy that he introduced that led to an increase in the debt? Apart from TARP, not one. The rise in the debt is due to the the programmes of previous﻿ Presidents and the dire economy he inherited.

At some point in the future there will be an objective assessment of President Obama's service to this﻿ country. Hopefully by then, the passions of ideology, and the half-truths and outright fabrications about him will have fallen aside, and facts will be used to measure what he has done with the power given to him by the American people.

you're already been screwed. Obama, our lovely president, is trying to take away our fire arms. In which, the 5th amendment clearly states, that the government can not take away our guns. Oh yeah, this guy really loves America. Yup...sending our troops to more places like Uganda, Libya, and now Turkey. Yes, good﻿ thing he isn't screwing us up!

the truth of the matter is that neither he (Barry Soetoro), John McShame, nor Romney (you call him Mittens which = O' Bamney) are illigible for the US Presidency. Don't get mad, believe me; if one was to do the﻿ research, one would find that either of the 3 would have yielded an illegitimate prez.
Besides that, Romney is Soetoro's twin & Soetoro (Obama/Barry) = Bush on STEROIDS. ';)

J, I am curious. Like every other video it seems you say this game you are commentating over is the first game you've played in 1+ weeks. Which is hard to believe.

This map reminds me of Carnival from MW2. With the little ramps and hallways and tunnels. I like Grind. The only map I don't care for is Mirage. It seems to be a "happy camper" map. The others were fun. We'll see if﻿ it lasts. I'm liking the Peacekeeper more as I advance it and unlock new attachments.

The mark of a truly awesome player. I don't give a shit who's better then who (your name is usually at the top 3 of most people's lists) but your play style is by far﻿ the sickest ive﻿ seen and IMO best public player. Speaking of, seeing as now there are some decent payouts for Pro MLG tourneys upcoming, do you think you would consider it?

Good video, liking the peace maker its pretty boss on hardcore. Been running around the new maps like a lunatic getting decent scores.
Although I do like the maps I have found them all to be kinda small, I was just hoping for at least one big one. But thats just me.﻿

The Peacekeeper is like a SMG﻿ version of the M27 in my opinion. 4 shot kills and low recoil. The reload animation is pretty similar too.

Looking for REVOLUTION gameplay? How about a 6 person Kill feed by the PEACEKEEPER. Come on over and check out my﻿ footage while i talk about the Newest dlc from Call of Duty Black Ops 2. This is all Multiplayer gameplay, but﻿ i show every new map!
I also use the peacekeeper with a couple different attachments! Come on over and check it out and if you enjoy the video leave a sub or a like it would help a bunch! Just started my channel 3 weeks ago so looking for a defined audience!

I doubt it. The only true similarities are the name and sights. They probably did take the idea from GCI though, but they changed the gun enough﻿ so that they couldn't be sued. GCI is a great game though. Now that I think about it, I might play it lol.

In my hands, its better than msmc. fast fire rate, good iron sights, very low recoil, fast reload, decent clip size. if it had 50 bullets in its clip it would be better than a pdw. use﻿ it with silencer, fast mag or laser sight, fast mag. its a beast

Its actually the weakest SMG. The only reason you say its OP is because its a pretty long range gun. All ranges in which you say SMG's should be weak, the Peacemaker keeps up its﻿ strength.

Don't blame Treyarch. Blame Activision and Microsoft for signing that timed exclusivity deal that guarantees that Xbox 360 will receive all DLC at least a month before PS3 and PC. That's how it's been for forever. It isn't Treyarch's fault.
Better yet, blame Sony for not being willing to spend tens of millions of dollars so﻿ THEY could get the DLC first.

People have been bitching about the exclusivity deal since MW2. After the record-breaking commercial success of MW3,﻿ Microsoft decided to renew that contract with Activision, before Black Ops II was even announced, if I'm not mistaken. "Why should they?" you ask? So that everyone on the Internet would be sitting here bitching about PS3 getting the DLC first and not Xbox 360.

Yes but it's not worth it. would you rather get a full game for $20 or a "DLC" for 15 i think. I think the answer is simple and btw the﻿ $20 game is assassin's creed 2. I have Ps3. i've been playing cod since mw3. (worst time to ever start playing cod.) People should be ready to move on since rinse and repeat can get old. and if you think Ps3 has it bad at least people could tell you to get the dlc or not before you buy it.

"Yes but it's not worth it." That is entirely﻿ subjective. You do have a point: as a consumer, the best thing you can do when buying entertainment is find a good balance between number of hours of possible entertainment and cost. Tens of millions of people play CoD every year, and millions of those people play it more than anything else.

I have over 10 days played in Black Ops II alone since the game's release, so for me, I know that spending $15 for a DLC pack is a great deal. I will get my money's worth. I will put many hundreds of hours more into BO2. But sure, for someone who is burnt out on CoD, or someone who﻿ only plays the game once or twice a week, it probably isn't worth it.

I just love the enthusiasm in Jay's videos. They always get me pumped and can seriously uplift your spirits for the day. Whew, if it weren't so late at night,﻿ I'd go enjoy me some Black Ops 2. You just make it seem so fun. Loved the vid, one of your best ones imo.

4daysagoFrom joy to tragedy: Inside the Brazil nightclub where 233 diedSlideshow: Nightclub fire in BrazilYuri Weber/ Agencia O Dia via ReutersAn interior view of the Kiss nightclub in Santa Maria, Brazil, after it was destroyed by a fire on Jan. 27. Launch slideshowBy Alastair Jamieson, Staff Writer,  NBC NewsShoes, bottles and slices of lime lay scattered around the blackened remains of a dancefloor in Brazil on Monday – signs of how quickly a Saturday night student party turned into one of the world’s worst nightclub fires.End-of-summer celebrations were in full swing at the Kiss club in the university town of Santa Maria when a band’s pyrotechnic display set fire to the sound-proofed ceiling and started a fire that choked dozens to death and saw dozens more trampled in the ensuing panic.The image of the burned, empty building was in stark contrast to the town’s packed gymnasium where relatives of the victims gathered late on Sunday to mourn after the mortuary became overwhelmed with bodies.

One woman fell to her knees in grief at the coffin of a relative, while others waited to identify their loved ones.In total, at least 233 died - 120 men and 113 women - while 92 people are still being treated in hospitals, Reuters reported.About 50 funerals were expected to take place at the municipal cemetery in Santa Maria on Monday, according to Brazilian television news broadcast Zero Hora.The cemetery opened early, at 7:30 a.m. local time (4:30 a.m. ET), and was planning to conduct burials at half-hour intervals, O Globo reported, saying the army had helped dig graves.A Brazilian nightclub owner and two members of a band have been arrested by civil police investigating the blaze, newspaper Diario de Santa Maria reported Monday. A fourth person is also being sought, the newspaper said.It said businessman Elissandro Spohr, also known as ‘Kiko’ – one of the owners of the Kiss nightclub in the city of Santa Maria – was detained “on a temporary basis.”Marcelo Arigony, a police inspector, said the arrests were "provisional" and that there was not yet a criminal accusation. He declined to confirm the identities of those arrested, saying the investigation "is still quite precarious."Sphor's lawyer, Jader Marques, told the Diario de Santa Maria that his client was present in the club with his pregnant wife at the moment that a spark from the pyrotechnic flare or fuse handled by the band lit the soundproofing on the ceiling.One of the worst nightclub fires in history has claimed a terrible toll in the southern Brazil city of Santa Maria, with at least 233 dead by the most recent count. Authorities and witnesses are saying the fire may have been sparked by a pyrotechnics show. NBC's Mike Taibbi reports.The main door of the nightclub was locked at the time, fire chief Guido Pedroso de Melo told O Globo.He added that firefighters responding to the blaze initially had trouble getting inside the nightclub because "there was a barrier of bodies blocking the entrance.”Survivors and the police inspector Marcelo Arigony said security guards briefly tried to block people from exiting the club, according to the AP, perhaps fearing that patrons would leave without paying their tab.But Arigony said the guards didn't appear to block fleeing patrons for long. "It was chaotic and it doesn't seem to have been done in bad faith because several security guards also died," he told the AP.In a radio interview, the band’s guitarist Rodrigo Martins said the fire began shortly after the band took to the stage at 2.15 a.m. local time Sunday."When the fire started, a guard passed us a fire extinguisher, the singer tried to use it but it wasn't working," he said, adding that the accordion player Danilo Jacques, 28, died, while the five other members made it out safely.Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report. Explore related topics: brazil, fire, nightclub, featured, santa-maria

Actually, start by banning "stupidity". Does this lean a little towards your post?! LOL

It said businessman Elissandro Spohr, also known as ‘Kiko’ – one of the owners of the Kiss nightclub in the city of Santa Maria – was detained “on a temporary basis.”

If you ask me, they probably saved his life. It's probably more for protection than anything else.

Survivors and the police inspector Marcelo Arigony said security guards briefly tried to block people from exiting the club, according to the AP, perhaps fearing that patrons would leave without paying their tab.

We all have a job to do however, there's a difference between simply doing your job, and knowing the difference between life and death.12 votes#1.6 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 12:39 PM ESTVincent-970634@Creek Dog, I hope this clears up a little bit...In today’s newspaper where I live (Rio) they showed what the inside of the building on how it was set up. There were two floors and on the first floor there are 5 rooms, (1 main dance floor, 2 side dance floors rooms, 2 private rooms  and a men’s and ladies bathrooms) with only one doorway to enter and exiting from each to the main floor. On the second floor was a walk around to view down below with one set of stairs. Here’s the painful part. There is ONLY one set of doors at the front of the building (enter and exiting) so the guards at those doors really didn’t know how bad this fire was because there is a wall blocking their view. The fire started somewhere in the back . 
Today all the flags are flying at half staff. This is a very, very sad event8 votes#1.7 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 1:11 PM ESTWinWin4AllThe guards at the door...this is the mentality that took place on the Titanic. The people in charge unable to adapt to a changing situation. On the Titanic, once they knew they had a problem, they didn't switch to survival mode right away - they were still concerned with treating first class passengers with a luxury experience. The passengers didn't switch over either. That cost a lot of lives. The guards at the door were in the mode of doing their job to protect the business and didn't make the mental switch to doing whatever is possible to save lives. It's human nature, unfortunately.5 votes#1.8 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 1:52 PM ESTBudsAndSuds

StandUpJokeOffInsufficient and unmarked fire exits, non-working fire extinguishers, overcrowding, combustible materials, locked doors (to keep non-paying people from coming in, usually)...
There have been PLENTY of similarly-documented cases throughout history.  Just look at the Cocoanut Grove fire in Boston which killed nearly 500 people in 1942 was much the same.  That incident should be an example for every business owner across the planet.

And some of you might say this didn't happen in the US, but it has numerous times such as the Rhode Island Night club fire plus a few others!!!!

Nightclubs have more purposes than guns.  Apparently you see your gun as a security blanket but to many of us all it is is an instrument of destruction. Nightclubs entertain, and are a social experience. Cars are also a mode of transportation, not just accidents waiting to happen. Knives also cut food and other materials. Guns have only 1 purpose, to kill stuff.  Thats all they do. They cannot help you with anything except to kill stuff.  I believe in the death penalty but I think it should be implemented after the offender has been given an opportunity to defend themselves. I do not think that it is your place in society to make that choice for the rest of us, or God forbid, have your own weapon used against you or a loved one.16 votes#2.7 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 11:23 AM ESTAshtarothDeath at the Club:  It's not just for Ecstacy anymore3 votes#2.8 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 11:27 AM ESTchris-2252558Really, So my gun is for destruction...

We wouldnt ban NIGHTCLUBS idiot.
We'd ban PYROTECHNICS IN NIGHTCLUBS.
I'll go a step further, I think pyrotechnics should be banned for all indoor use. Too many variables, too many ways things can go wrong...and it simply isnt worth the loss of life.

All Pyrotechnics were banned in the state until the 1980's when AC/DC successfully showed the state fire marshals how pyro could be safely used indoors. Pyro can be safely used in a large arena or indoor stadium under the right circumstances, I've seen it done. It's rigidly controlled and has to have clearance by the state fire marshal, no exceptions. But a nightclub is never the right place for something like this.6 votes#2.12 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 11:54 AM ESTsam adams
So my gun is for destruction... YOUR STUPID, my gun had helped me in the pass fend off robberies

First of all, thanks for clarifying your intelligence with this statement.  Secondly, what was the purpose of your gun if it wasn't to hurt someone?6 votes#2.13 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 12:08 PM ESTCody Barnesvia FacebookChris your stupid example WAS destruction, the threat of injury/death is what scared the robbers away, the gun was just your weapon of choice but know what else works? A big dog ! Or a large knife, hell even yelling loudly could work. I bet you leave your doors unlocked and windows open just HOPING a robber tries his luck, just so you can shoot someone.4 votes#2.14 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 12:09 PM ESTSuds in DenverBeing roasted alive does not sound like a good way to go.  When I watched the Hurricane Sandy relief concert with all of the fireworks and such at the end I was stunned at the intensity of it and wondered how anyone could not have been singed by it especially those in the front of the concert.  Seemed pretty dangerous.  Pyrotechnics, while cool to watch, look too dangerous for an inside venue.2 votes#2.15 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 12:12 PM ESTNCwolvChris - banning nightblubs using your Sandy Hook analogy would equate to people wanting to ban elementary schools. Now I'm sure many of you idiot, guns-at-all-cost folk would probably propose banning elementary schools before guns, but no one is in fact petitioning for that. But thanks for proving once again why not everyone deserves to own a gun.4 votes#2.16 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 12:18 PM ESTDawn-411965Chris - too bad we couldn't ban you and your irrelevant comments. Your emotional detachment to the loss of lives in any type of tradegy is so sad. What happened to you that you care more about guns than someone losing a loved one? Over two hundred people lost their lives and you want to revert back to the nightmare of Sandy Hook and guns? Think for two seconds before you type.6 votes#2.17 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 12:21 PM ESTLisa C-5522681Chris--this really isn't the right venue for discussing our 2nd Amendment rights.  Trying to compare an incident of violent insanity like Sandy Hook with an incident like a nightclub fire due to incompetence and negligence is like comparing apples to acorns.  And please understand that I am not anti-gun, since my husband and I like to shoot skeet, and we also like to hunt wild game to eat.  
Missamy, since you mentioned it, I will make one additional comment.  My husband and I have both a German Shepherd and a firearm for home defense.  We reason that  the sound of our dog barking and the sound of a round chambering is enough to scare off 99% of all burglars and so we probably will never have to actually fire a shot.  For the other 1%--they would have to be crazy or high on drugs, which would make them very dangerous.  There was an elderly couple 2 doors down from us who, several years ago, had a home invasion happen to them--a late teens or early 20's man barged in with a baseball bat--thank God the elderly couple had 2 big dogs that scared the guy off.  They could have NEVER defended themselves alone against that invader.  And if he had been crazy enough to start swinging at the dogs?--Who knows what would have happened!?!  BTW, I am in favor of background checks, and I believe that people who are psychotic should not be given access or allowed to buy firearms either.6 votes#2.18 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 12:23 PM ESTJohn Haddock Comment collapsed by the communitybrazil needs to seriously consider banning fire. banning fire of any kind needs to be seriously considered. how many more senseless deaths have to occur at the hands of evil people starting fires? if it wasnt for fire, these 180 or more people would still be alive. if brazil bans fire from everyone, then there will be no deaths at the hands of fire ever again.

I think businesses owe it to their customers to provide a reasonable level of safety to all who enter their premise. 
Any business that has customers come inside a building owes it to them and employees to have enough exits to accommodate the maximum allowable crowd. Employees should be trained to direct a mass exit, so it doesn't become a trampling, panicky nightmare.
And, pyrotechnics doesn't have to be outlawed, but like any potentially lethal entity, extreme safety standards have to be applied and enforced. An indoor stadium, built to handle pyrotechnics, can be safe, so long as procedures are followed. A nightclub - probably not. Why don't facilities have to have a fire marshall approve use of pyrotechnics? 
It's not like this is the first time something like this has happened. I don't think it's even a matter of greed that it happened again. It's stupidity. And it's criminal. People need to go to prison over this.1 vote#2.23 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 2:08 PM ESTdavid-475776

 But coming from a nation of alcoholics, I am not surprised about the replies!!! 1 vote#2.26 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 5:01 PM ESTchris-2252558Ok, maybe I did say nightclubs should be banned, what I meant was the pyrotechnics..   But still, how is this different from Sandy Hook and Obama trying to enforce laws against the 2nd amendment?  People still die each day from even car accidents, but you don't see a call to end all cars on the road!!!  Same goes for all the nightclubs that promotes violence, all those kids that die each year from going to a night club either overdosing, being stabbed, raped, or consuming to much alcohol is still far greater in number then the elementary school shootings!!!  #2.27 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 5:32 PM ESTlilirocks@chris-2252558
What you fail to acknowledge is that you're not very fond of nightclubs (you're almost certainly, not a young man) and they don't make a significant part of your life, while guns do. Guns are part of your interests. So you're basically telling others that their interest is unimportant because it's not part of your own.
Life is full of dangers, and for many "danger" actually means excitement. Everyone dies someday, but most of us try to avoid death or injury while living to the fullest. 
For many, a quiet and sedentary life, while safe, is not worth living. We take precautions on our risks and our only safeguard is to be as smart as we can be -to avoid damage. 
Our society claims that driving, while actually following all the laws, is pretty safe. But again, that claim is only subject to others who we have no control over. Even though we have many more cars every year, car safety has increased together with human neglect. The "safety" part cannot keep up with human distractions and gadgets.
But comparing killings with deadly weapons to accidental deaths, is very illogical or naive, at best.3 votes#2.28 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 7:27 PM EST

Many governments prohibit use of fireworks unless given a permit and normally the user needs to show they received safety training. My state prohibited fireworks use after a town's main street was burned down. No one died in this fire, just over 100 buildings lost. In this current fire trend it is hundreds of lives are being lost.  This seems to be getting to be a trend where bands at an indoor venue have started a flash fire. It just needs to be outlawed, no indoor pyrotechnics.2 votes#5.1 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 9:06 AM ESTKevin Valentine MoraesMay the Souls of the Faithful, Departed through the Mercy of God Rest in Peace.

Your 'all seeing, all knowing, all forgiving' god has once again committed mass murder and suffering and you will say to the 'faithful,'  'departed through 'god's mercy,' may they rest in peace,' and may a 'perpetual light shine upon them;' 
I submit to you that, your 'god' has given them only the perpetual light of hell.  Their last view, permitted by your god, was one of horror, suffering and for them and their loved ones, a welcoming to hell.

While it's true that these two incidents were in two different countries, this is the Internet age, and surely this kind of information can be disseminated.  Frankly I'm shocked to learn of yet another incident involving Pyrotechnics, a nightclub, and the death of so many persons.

Although we don't know all the details of this incident, the Rhode Island incident and most others involve multiple violations of safety laws and an illegal use of pyrotechnics.
Those who legally perform pyrotechnics aren't the problem, since they involve full inspections by the fire department on exits, fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems, maintaining capacity as well as the safe use of pyrotechnics. Greedy and careless bar owners and entertainment acts will bypass the legalities to avoid the safety inspections. Banning indoor pyrotechnics will increase the use of pyro without a permit.
What is needed is tougher enforcement, which only seems to happen in the aftermath of a disaster such as this, when it is already too late for hundreds of people and their families.#11 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 10:06 AM ESTSeattle SunshineMadDog, (tic) did you plagiarize your comment from a gun control argument a few days back?

The fire that J. Hicks referred to.  A horrific involving a nightclub which was overcrowded, rear doors locked  and a band with pyrotechnics on stage. It can happen anywhere as many have stated. What matters is what politicians do after this occurs. In the U.S., four different national fire codes were enacted at the national level. No more duplicate disasters like the Station nightclub fire. What will Brazil do. It's great that their leader comes home to do the politically correct thing, but traveling to Rio four times, I can say that Rio and most big cities in Brazil are just one big party. This has happened before, just not with the high number of deaths. Will their president do different than the other leaders in the past. They better get their act together because the Olympics will be there very soon and international travelers will expect more than another tragedy where their president tells them how sorry she is. Lots of critics in this post ( yes I read the last five pages), ....read up on the station nightclub fire and do your homework to see what Brazil should do. This story deserves a lot more than opinions and lip service. We'll see what happens in the next year. Like I said the Olympics will be there soon and Brazilians are very proud people who, like many in other countries, refuse to admit their short comings when it comes to life safety. If anyone is interested in seeing what this may have looked like on the inside during the tragic event then go to firefighternation and in the search box type in unedited footage from station nightclub. If you have a weak stomach then don't watch this, however, Brazilans President should look at this closely.1 vote#12 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 10:13 AM ESTG A CusterPyrotechnics are ridiculous entertainment for a band.

dmddebMy heart goes out to the families of the ones killed and injured in this tragic fire! The exit doors should never be locked, and if protechnics are used or not, before any concert or gathering of a large group of people, there should be announcements made as to where the exits are located in case of an emergency. What about sprinkler systems? Shouldn't they be installed in places like this?#13 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 10:36 AM ESTchris-2252558Well, should we start banning Nightclubs?

It's a wonder to me why this sort of thing doesn't happen more often. Most clubs and bars have a small front entrance so they can control who comes and goes and other exits are locked or blocked to keep people from getting in without paying or skipping on tabs. Trust me when I say this.....there is no way to hurriedly exit hundreds of people from a venue even if it wasn't on fire. After the party starts and things get to hoppin...people are usually oblivious to whats going on around them.  Sprinkler systems and plenty of double door exits clearly marked should be mandatory.....but that only works with strict regulation which usually doesn't happen. The town I live in put those regs in place after the RI fire. You can't get a permit unless the fire system is up to code. It cut down on "Fly By Nite" clubs here. Just too costly to do biz.

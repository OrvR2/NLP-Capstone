Saudi Arabia is a shit country mixing backwards culture, and religion with rampant consumerism.  Why the hell do they need so many maids anyways?  If their women don't work, and just stay at home why do they need so many servants?  They are the laziest Arabs, and they all seem a little gay since they can't mix with the other gender.

But what if a Jewish woman marries a Muslim man?  Technically wouldn't that kid be both, by that I mean both religions could claim that child.  Judaism is passed through the mother, but Islam is passed through the father.  This is a case of Kramer vs Ali.

So often the attitude is about what women should do to protect themselves, there should be more focus on changing men's attitude.  What makes men think that this is ok?  How can any man justify raping a woman in any circumstance?  Too often society blames the woman for"allowing" herself to be raped, it's disgusting and until that attitude changes, rape will continue and the victims will remained shamed and gagged into silence.

To think trading with your African neighbors will be easy and will bring you power and riches is very naive.  You also say tourist will come because they want it.  Tourists need to feel secure, and they also like a certain amount freedom in doing what they want.  Doesn't mean they think they can do anything but most like to have a drink and not be covered head to toe.  Why don't you ask some Egyptians that work in tourist industry, (again Egypt's biggest sources of income) what they think.

Any who the America women did exceptionally well, they're the reason why we had the the medal count we did.  But I would like to say that there were Muslim women that did great just look at the Turkish women that came in 1st and 2nd in the 1500, so don't hide behind Islam because if Turkey is proud of their female athletes then you ugly men don't have a leg to stand on.

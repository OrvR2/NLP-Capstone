jew3hitler: 'This ----- had to go because she is jewish"
And Hitler was a Hittite. You have﻿ not one good thing to say about anyone. Prejudice of one's Faith is so contrary to every edict ever ventured into. Prejudice & vile hatred the very reason why thrashing of other whites, i.e. a supposed 'movement' of where one needs not another to fill their shoes to do the very thing not permissable by any community with any sense, i.e. warfare declared against one's supposed 'ownership' of a race XYX

You keep going Hillary. If you should decide to run for President in 2016 there are several who say they will vote for you. Hopefully by then most of Congress and the Senate will have some new faces who respect the principles of which the United States is founded upon.
Now why is it again that women were not rendered equal status long ago. Religion, money-status protects the old order of inequalities that by now are so vagrant which have no place inside﻿ an enlightened world.

I think you have the political insight of a speck of ecoli. You are perfect chumps for the clinton's of the world. Know this fool, no insider in politics believes we'll ever see this crook again. So don't waste your life, her shrieking display at the hearing and the FACT that this coward couldn't represent for over 4 months has set the cause of women for president back at least a decade. You should be happy this globetrotting﻿ narcissistic liar is kaput! I AM DELIGHTED!

Listen schizo, if I had the crook'saddress﻿ I'd give it to you because she deserves a crazy stalker of her very own.While I have a psycho on the line, can you explain why it took over 4 months for this cowardly bitch to make any formal appearance to explain her agency's role in bengazzi. Take away a month for her illness and you have more than 3 months of zero accountability. That's a dirty arrogant cowardly bitch for you! She crapped on America and now she's out!!

If women were treated equally...so self-evident that the Breath of Life was distributed to every living creature equally...so false is where the wallet(s) of man come in between as﻿ evidence that equality does not exist...
Barter & Trade; all else constitutes slave(s).
A so very untrue value system: This one has money, this one has none.
You go, Hillary Clinton. The oppression of not only women, but their equals called men is when their other half suffers oppression & so all dignity suffers.

So glad you could come and stay and prove your salt is salt to burn another 'witch' at the stake...just vitrolic hatred of the most beautiful Secretary of State...the perfect gift given today is to prove what a horrible, hateful, most disturbed person you are, where value of others is so far off the radar of your own unvirtuous, unworthy...how many﻿ words need to be stated until you just go walk off a Hieroglyph...
The so very similar things said re: Hillary, her illness via white trash views...

The Secretary of State is so very beautiful today. In fact this is the most beautiful she has ever been. Everything about her radiates. She shines﻿ forth as does her lovely daughter Chelsea.
Truly they are so very beautiful as they shine forth rays of sunshine, gladness, hope...instead of despair and hopelessness as has been for so very long virtually the entire political system that has effected so many for so very long.
May the Gods long Bless Hillary Clinton and her family~Hills of Clinton~

mrjesusthedestroyer: "Good thing this terrorist is finally﻿ leaving."
Your mentality: is it of a teenager who is out of sync with himself. You call her a terrorist.﻿ Really, how so. She burned cookies in the Middle East but then went another way: Nefertiti Bathsheba. She sat down with the Israeli P.M.
Now don't hesitate, think just one byte:
A 'terrorist' can also be one who villifies over and over repeated multitudes of times vs. those not them, i.e., Heads of State, famous persons, others.

Lying under oath to the commision about what happened in Bengahzi. Does it sound legal to you to lie under oath. Bengahzi wasnt a embassy. It was a CIA HQ to distribute weapons to﻿ militant groups including Al Qaeda in Syria and other rebels. The same weapons that we confiscated when we invaded Lybia using the same terrorist groups we sent to Syria. They didnt fired the head of the CIA two weeks after for cheating on his wife, thats BS, but how would they explain that the US is arming Al Qaeda.

I agree that women should be treated equally. Its very important. I have an issue when whole races of people are still oppressed here and abroad and its taboo to speak on that in a public political forum. I would be all behind her if I didn't think it was a political move for her gain﻿ alone. Hillary has come to be or maybe has always been a selfish politician making power move after power move at the expense of some else. I sincerely hope she never becomes president. It would be horrible.

I got a thought. Is Bush relevant anymore? What I mean is, can we fire him from something? Is he still in charge, so that we can pressure him to improve something? I don't think so. Hang Bush, right next﻿ to Obama and all the rest involved with the corruption. Let them swing together. This corruption has a name, it's "The United States Political system."

But the commentator stated 'The Clintons', That means Bill is also included. Is he relevant?
Also, the acts of someone loses all relevancy and historicity when he is not in charge?
You know it's quite﻿ demagogic when naming someone or group of people in bad manor and leaving others untouched?

Do you think they should all hang or none? If not Hang, then at lease try them all in court? If we look at the United States Tax Money like Cheese, and it is mounted on a trap (United States Political Offices) perhaps you can see why a working trap﻿ would snap while whatever rat happens to be currently munching on the cheese, even though other rats have already eaten their share and gone off. Might that not at least start a crack-down or scare the other rats ( corrupt Politicians)?

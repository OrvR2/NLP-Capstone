I think everyone needs to take time and remeber the holocast. It's just so disrespectful and aggravating to see all these losers making jew jokes and swasticas all the time like nothing and it's fun and games until it's your culture and bad history being spitted on like that. It's just sad very sad and I'm not even jewish.﻿

All of us should remember the lessons of the history to avoid the repeating of such horrors.
There were many innocent children killed in this and other prison camps.
What for ones were born?
This is out of understanding for normal people and only the beasts in﻿ man guise like fascists could commit such awful crimes.

People lack the perspective of most who were forced to face the reality of those events in that time. Now we can look back and say "that with history, we﻿ should get over it" because it doesnt pertain to this generation.
If other such tragedies are to be avoided, prevented, or ceased in the present, we must understand and appreciate the past they came out of, instead of ignoring or poking fun at the horrendous suffering of others.

By claiming that one holocaust is real (as if others arent), or more important﻿ than another, is perhaps the most utterly idiotic and morally reprehensible thing you could state in the context of mass slaughter, torture and genocide.
If these events matter to you, you would not trivialize one by placing emphasis on the other- Jew, Armenian, German, African, Sikh, Kurd, whatever.
tragedy is tragedy, extent is inconsequential.

We need to remember the "real" Holocaust against more than 3.5 million German civilians after 1945. 15 million Germans had been expelled and attested 3.5 million German civilians had been raped, tortured, slaughtered and bestially﻿ killed by Czech, Polish, Yugoslavian and Russian hordes. Attested 200.000 German girls and women had been raped by Russian soldiers ONLY in Berlin and altogether - attested - "2 Million" German girls and women !! The dark figure is much higher !

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Seeking to put to rest questions on whether Barack Obama was a straight shooter when he claimed he went skeet shooting "all the time," the White House on Saturday offered proof: a photo of the president blasting away at clay targets.
              Obama drew skepticism when he made the assertion in a recent interview with the New Republic magazine, an attempt to show sympathy for hunters even as he pushes for tighter gun controls after the Newtown school shooting massacre in December.
              Obama's aides were in the awkward position of standing by his comments while resisting reporters' demands for proof that he was indeed a regular on the shooting range at the presidential retreat in the Maryland mountains.
 The White House finally weighed in on Saturday with a photo of Obama skeet shooting at Camp David last August 4.
              "For all the ‘skeeters'," Obama senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said in a Twitter message linked to the photo, which showed the president - wearing sunglasses, jeans and noise mufflers on his ears - firing a rifle with smoke spraying from the barrel.
              It was unclear, however, whether a single photo would satisfy skeptics about his claim that he and his guests frequently shoot clay pigeons at Camp David.
              Obama, in the New Republic interview, was asked if he had ever fired a gun.
              "Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time," Obama said.
              "The whole family?" he was asked.
              "Not the girls, but oftentimes guests of mine go up there. And I have a profound respect for the traditions of hunting that trace back in this country for generations. And I think those who dismiss that out of hand make a big mistake."
              Conservative critics immediately questioned the Democratic president's assertion, and talk show comedians had a field day with the idea that he had taken up shooting as a hobby.
              U.S. Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, even challenged Obama to a skeet-shooting contest.
              Obama's comment was widely seen as an attempt to reach out to gun owners to ease their concerns about his legislative proposals, the biggest gun control push in decades. He will travel to Minnesota on Monday to speak on gun control.

Xyzzy, a well regulated militia was defined in 1792. "That each and every free able-bodied white male citizen of the respective States, resident therein, who is or shall be of age of eighteen years, and under the age of forty-five years (except as is herein after excepted) shall severally and respectively be enrolled in the militia ... That every citizen, so enrolled and notified, shall, within six months thereafter, provide himself with a good musket or firelock" 
Our founders expected every able bodied male to own a firearm and if more advanced arms existed at the time they would have wanted them.

good caliber for shooting skeet?? anything from a 410 up to and including a 12 guage.  Certainly not a rifle.

"........firing a RIFLE with smoke spraying from the barrel."  That's one of the problems with the media right there. The author of this article doesn't know the difference between a rifle and a SHOTGUN. Mr Spetalnick,that's a shotgun. You have obviously never touched one. Btw, you might want to look into the difference between an automatic rifle and an assault rifle. Only the military owns the latter. The public only owns "Assault STYLE" rifles.

I'm not a skeet shooter but I have watched others.  When people are really skeet shooting, the skeets are released high into the air not head high like Obama is shooting at.  Launching them that low is a profound safety problem.  It's also hard to see the little buggers if they are back dropped by trees and etc. instead of clear blue sky.

Take a piece of paper and line it up on the barrel rib in the photo and you will see that the rib lines up with Obama's eyebrow, not his eye. Are his eyes closed, or is aiming with the eyebrow a new shotgunner's technique?

You're kidding, right?? If people like big o think the 2nd amendment is about shooting skeet, that could be the problem. I do not want to protect the constitution so people can kill a little clay disk even though that is one of the things the 2nd protects. It way more than skeet. (and shooting skeet is not hunting either)

Welcome﻿ to the Prison Industrial Complex!
Where money and connections mean more than the truth and true justice!
Wake up my fellow brothers and sisters for the next four years will be like never before.

It is certainly time for the People to rise up. Rise to the occasion and take down the Banksters﻿ and those whom do their dirty woek, just as this "justice", and you may only use that term lightly, any longer. Time to put them in their Corporate prisons and let them enjoy the accomodations, as they built them to be. Enough is Enough. The Facism MUST End. The system is broken beyond repair and Facists never have a place amongst real human beings.

American﻿ justice system is about as unjust as you can get. The real criminals: bankers get bailed out, while the petty crime gets outrageous sentences.

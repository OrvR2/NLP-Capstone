PHOENIX (AP) — A gunman opened fire at a Phoenix office building on Wednesday, wounding three people, one of them critically, authorities said. Police were searching for the shooter.
The remaining two victims' injuries were not life-threatening, Sgt. Tommy Thompson said.
Police do not believe the shooting was a random act, Thompson said. Authorities said police so far believe there was only one shooter but don't know where he is.
The gunfire prompted terrified workers throughout the complex to lock the doors to their offices and hide far from the windows. SWAT officers searched the building.
"Everyone was just scared, honestly, just scared," said Navika Sood, assistant director of nursing at First at Home Health Services who along with her co-workers locked the entrances to their office.
Sood said authorities evacuated the office about 30 minutes after she first heard the popping noises.
The shooting took place on the same day that hearings on legislation to address gun violence were convened in Washington, with former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords testifying for stricter gun controls.
A gunman shot Giffords in the head during a shooting rampage in Tucson in January 2011.
Around 10:30 a.m., the gunman arrived at the office building and got into a dispute with someone, a conflict that escalated to the point where he drew a gun and shot three people, Thompson said.
Vannessa Brogan, who works in sales support at an insurance business in the three-story complex, said she heard a loud bang that she thought at first was from somebody working in or near the building.
She said others at the business thought they heard multiple loud noises. She said people locked themselves in offices until authorities evacuated the complex that houses insurance, medical and law offices.
Becky Neher, who works for a title company in the building, said the two gunshots she heard sounded like two pieces of metal banging against each other.
Watching from her second-story office, she saw people leaving the building.
"Someone yelled, 'We have a shooter,'" she said. She saw two victims lying on the ground outside the back side of the building. She said health care workers who have offices in the complex came out to help.
Don Jaksa, a software consultant who works in the building, said he was listening to the radio when he suddenly heard "two pops." He said he didn't think they were gunshots.
"My co-worker goes to the range all the time," he said. "He identified it as gunfire."
His co-worker then locked the door. After five minutes, they left and ran into police and someone carrying a stretcher. The police escorted them back to their office and told them to lock the door again.
They were eventually evacuated, and as he sat on a rock outside the complex, his wife called to make sure he was OK after seeing the shooting on the news.
Workers were later allowed to leave the building. Two hugged each other when they got outside.
"You don't expect this when you come to work," worker Lindsa Rincon said.

Classical example on inabilities of people to solve their problems without violence - low coping skills and an even lower emotional intelligence adds much. ....

Peeing in the office coffee pot just wasn't enough "revenge" for this guy anymore.

What is wrong with people? Please, just shoot yourself and do the rest of use a favor.  Putting guards in schools is fine, next will be hospitals (not just unarmed rent a cops), businesses, churches, post offices, and restaurants.  Guards on buses, housing areas with guards at the main gate - where will it all end.

This is why you never ever ever react angrily to any stranger confrontation; you never know if they are armed and psycho. And that includes traffic fights.

Here's an example of the problem.  In this thread, I mentioned that my neighbor had about a dozen guns stolen.  One reply stated- "i hope you get shot with one of those guns Dale."  This is a person who thinks guns make people safer.  He wants me shot for disagreeing. I happen to own a gun.  But he perceived me as the enemy.  He is why guns need to be controlled.

Opinion - Georgie Anne Geyer
WE IGNORE HISTORY AT OUR PERILGeorgie Anne Geyer - Thu, Jan 31, 2013WASHINGTON -- During the 1990s, when I was passing through Tunis while covering the Middle East, the country's foreign minister paused for a moment in his description of Tunisia's problems and spoke of how the Afghan war of the '80s had affected all of North Africa."We've been seeing," he said soberly, "the hundreds of young men from this part of the world pouring back across the north of Africa, angry and bitter after the Soviets finally left Afghanistan. Even though the Russians lost and the mujahedeen -- in effect, these young men -- won, they seem to have nothing to live for. ...

In effect, he said that he was not against all wars, but that he was against the people who start them. ... More »KERRY IS FITTING SUCCESSOR TO CLINTONOBAMA'S SECOND TERM MAY GIVE US NEW VOCABULARYGeorgie Anne Geyer - Thu, Jan 24, 2013WASHINGTON -- The world may turn out to be not much different during Barack Obama's second term, but from what we have to go on now, the language to describe it certainly appears to be.All you've had to do, in these weeks since the election, is to listen carefully to the words used on both sides to describe the other's ideology or makeup. Each side is using not words that could be construed as insulting or nasty, but rather as politically loaded -- words that still have plenty of provocative history clinging to them.Words like "collective," for instance. ... More »OBAMA'S SECOND TERM MAY GIVE US NEW VOCABULARYWE COULD LEARN A FEW THINGS IN NORTH AFRICAGeorgie Anne Geyer - Mon, Jan 21, 2013WASHINGTON -- While never abandoning the possibility that I'm the one who is peculiar, I find myself considering whether the questions being asked on television about events in Mali and northwestern Africa are not, in fact, themselves notably peculiar."Why did we let the French get ahead of us? Why didn't we just go out there in the desert and clean it up?" one anchor actually asked. "It's been six hours since the attack," another put forward, referring to the Jan. 16 attack by Islamic radicals on Algeria's In Amenas gas facility. ... More »WE COULD LEARN A FEW THINGS IN NORTH AFRICA'ZERO DARK THIRTY' IS A WINDOW INTO THE FUTUREGeorgie Anne Geyer - Thu, Jan 17, 2013WASHINGTON -- For those of us who think we have seen every war film Hollywood can offer, I have a surprise for you: "Zero Dark Thirty" rates up there on the topmost level with "Sergeant York," "From Here to Eternity" and "The Bridge on the River Kwai."Doubtless Americans are rushing to see it because they feel they know the "real story" about how American SEALs, backed by the CIA and special operations forces, were able to get Osama bin Laden.There he had been, the world's "most wanted" ideological renegade and killer, in a secret, grimy, three-story house in suburban Pakistan. ...

We have come to a point in American history where the war-crazy Republicans are cursing two of the nation's greatest war heroes ... And who knows what the war heroes are going to do next?On the surface, the situation about to spring on the nation involves two fine middle-aged Americans. Both have brilliantly served their country in war and in peace. Former Sen. ... More »OLD WARS ARE CONSTANTLY FOUGHT ANEWTALE OF ARMSTRONG'S TRANGRESSIONS ARE WRITTEN ON HIS FACEGeorgie Anne Geyer - Mon, Jan 7, 2013WASHINGTON -- It may be my own quirky and subjective view, but it seems to me that Lance Armstrong's face has reflected more of his transformation over the last two decades than does his biography.I could, of course, be remembering wrongly, since I have never met the man and am working only from photographs in newspapers. Or it may be that I am misjudging certain expressions of his. But his face has become hardened, toughened and even contorted as he has gone through years of barefaced "innocence." He is now rumored to be on the verge of a confession. ... More »TALE OF ARMSTRONG'S TRANGRESSIONS ARE WRITTEN ON HIS FACEOUTRAGE IN INDIA MAY BE HARBINGER OF CULTURAL CHANGEGeorgie Anne Geyer - Thu, Jan 3, 2013WASHINGTON -- Many years ago, in 1971 to be exact, I was covering the Middle East for the old Chicago Daily News when I came upon horrific cultural practices being exercised on women. From the northern Arab states to central black Africa, young girls were being tortured in order to be "chaste" and "pure" as wives and mothers.So, of course, I wrote about it, certain as the rising sun that I would change those worlds.The practice that so enraged me -- and many educated Egyptian, Sudanese and Saharan women -- was known as "cliteridectomy," or "female circumcision," or just plain "cutting. ... More »OUTRAGE IN INDIA MAY BE HARBINGER OF CULTURAL CHANGESOFT ISSUES NEED ATTENTION AS A NEW YEAR BEGINSGeorgie Anne Geyer - Thu, Dec 27, 2012WASHINGTON -- A new year is once again upon us. It comes, as they all do, with the soul of unbeatable determination. It's love at first sight, and then disappointment as reality sinks in. This year, the view over the cliff is harsh and unrelenting, waiting for us to jump.Yet while we are talking almost exclusively about the "hard" issues ahead of us -- economic breakdown here, currency rate-fixing in Europe, and guns mowing down our children -- our serious issues aren't necessarily the hard ones. ... More »SOFT ISSUES NEED ATTENTION AS A NEW YEAR BEGINSNEW YEAR BRINGS NEW REASONS TO HOPEGeorgie Anne Geyer - Fri, Dec 21, 2012(EDITORS: Geyer will file one column during each of the next two weeks -- on Thursday, Dec. 27, and Thursday, Jan. 3.)WASHINGTON -- I almost hate to say it, but I feel relatively optimistic about the New Year. Am I mad? Quite possibly. I am quite aware that we still face going over the fiscal cliff, 20 innocents were massacred by a crazy young man in Connecticut and fellow Americans have lost homes, jobs and respectability.But it seems to me that we may have turned a corner. ... More »NEW YEAR BRINGS NEW REASONS TO HOPEOBAMA RISES TO LEADERSHIP IN WAKE OF NATIONAL HEARTBREAKGeorgie Anne Geyer - Mon, Dec 17, 2012WASHINGTON -- If this was not President Obama's finest hour, one has to wonder when or where it will be.His speech before the disbelieving parents, children, clergymen and neighbors of Newtown, Conn., Sunday night carried through on the difficult task of being mournful one moment, intellectual the next and bitterly angry the next. Suddenly, unless I'm mistaken, the man who never quite became a convincing leader during his first term became a president one could believe in. ... More »OBAMA RISES TO LEADERSHIP IN WAKE OF NATIONAL HEARTBREAKNO LAUGHING MATTERGeorgie Anne Geyer - Mon, Dec 10, 2012WASHINGTON -- So now we know -- or ought to know -- when a hoax is not a hoax. The popular definition would seem to be that a hoax remains simply a hoax when everybody survives it. But the denouement of the case of the two Australian DJs who phoned the hospital where England's Kate was resting does not, unfortunately, meet that test.We all know by now that the nurse who took the phone call from Down Under has committed suicide and that everybody from St. James' Palace to King Edward VII Hospital, a favorite healing place of the royal family, is enraged about the foolish and frivolous prank.  ... More »NO LAUGHING MATTERNEW CHINESE LEADERSHIP THROWS OUT OLD FORMALITYGeorgie Anne Geyer - Thu, Dec 6, 2012WASHINGTON -- We are now thankfully past the repugnant campaigns for political office in our beloved country. If there are any real rules about how our politicians should behave, one has to struggle to uncover them.American candidates spin their pasts so much that one can only wonder about their futures. Expensive negative advertising apparently turns some Americans on as much as it turns me off.So today I say, "Bless the Chinese." Yes, bless them all, from Shanghai to Shenzhen and beyond. ... More »NEW CHINESE LEADERSHIP THROWS OUT OLD FORMALITYMIDDLE EAST DRAMA NEEDS SOMEONE TO TAKE LEADING ROLEGeorgie Anne Geyer - Tue, Dec 4, 2012WASHINGTON -- First, there was that moment of hope in the Middle East. Even as Israeli troops massed on poor but ever-obstreperous Gaza's borders late last month, the world took a deep breath. A ceasefire was signed between Israel and the radical Hamas!Even better, the new Egyptian Islamic president, Mohamed Morsi, arrived confidently on the scene. It seemed that he would honor Egypt's peace treaty with Israel after all. ... More »MIDDLE EAST DRAMA NEEDS SOMEONE TO TAKE LEADING ROLEMOVE TOWARD THEOCRACY IN EGYPT IS ONLY THE FIRST STEPGeorgie Anne Geyer - Thu, Nov 29, 2012WASHINGTON -- One of the hallmarks of a good journalist, and especially a good foreign correspondent, is to bring to a story every bit of history and background you can beg, steal or borrow. This is particularly important when the story at hand is complicated and deadly. "Parachuting" in on a story without depth of knowledge, as many younger journalists do today, is virtually always a synonym for superficiality. ... More »MOVE TOWARD THEOCRACY IN EGYPT IS ONLY THE FIRST STEPDEMOCRACY IS ON A ROCKY COURSE IN EGYPTGeorgie Anne Geyer - Mon, Nov 26, 2012WASHINGTON -- When the first demonstrations and then riots began tearing apart Cairo and other cities of the Middle East almost two years ago, this unusual "Arab Spring" inspired many good people across the globe to outbursts of idealistic hope.Fall, ye autocrats, whether Mubarak in Egypt, ben Ali in Tunisia or al-Assad in Syria! For now cometh the new democracies never known in this biblical wilderness of authoritarian systems and structures!John F. ...

They think of a jolly day whose bounty of blessings easily gives way to singing, swaying together beside a popping fireplace or walking through the snow after a good nap.Many still pause to remember that first Thanksgiving in the autumn of 1621 in New England. Plymouth Colony Gov. ... More »GREED JOINS THE FEAST AT THANKSGIVING FAILURE OF MILITARY LEADERSHIP GOES BEYOND PETRAEUSGeorgie Anne Geyer - Thu, Nov 15, 2012WASHINGTON -- Why did Gen. David Petraeus do it? Why did Paula Broadwell do it? Did Gen. John Allen do it at all? And did Jill Kelley do it next to the caviar?Those are the questions that have been hurtling around the hallways and reception rooms in our nation's capital. ... More »FAILURE OF MILITARY LEADERSHIP GOES BEYOND PETRAEUSCASUALTY OF WARGeorgie Anne Geyer - Mon, Nov 12, 2012WASHINGTON -- When military officers, foreign correspondents or aid workers go to war, their world suddenly becomes an entirely new one. Nothing that was familiar is so any longer. They find themselves doing things they never before dreamed they would do. That, it strikes me, is most probably the situation former CIA Director David Petraeus found himself in, along with a beautiful Army reservist who was as much an obsessive on running long miles as "her" four-star general. ... More »CASUALTY OF WARLET'S HOPE MODERATION MAKES A COMEBACKGeorgie Anne Geyer - Thu, Nov 8, 2012WASHINGTON -- Now that the elections are over -- and with them, at least temporarily, all the talk about the United States veering to the far left or the far right -- let us consider "moderation."The word did pop up occasionally during the 25 years of this campaign ... oops, I mean the many months of this campaign, in which we dutifully studied whether Barack Obama or Mitt Romney would be better for our digestion (so we wouldn't spit out our hatreds so disastrously) or our drinking (as we always tell our doctors, we drink "moderately"). ... More »LET'S HOPE MODERATION MAKES A COMEBACKLEADERS FAIL TO CURB CASINO CAPITALISM Georgie Anne Geyer - Mon, Nov 5, 2012WASHINGTON -- Shortly before the election, new Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, a distinguished economist who took the place of the fun-loving Silvio Berlusconi, was in Washington, and he paused several times to express his wonder at Germany's economic attitude."Why, they see economics as virtue," he expostulated wryly to Charlie Rose. "It is virtuous to be not in debt and to save. Power flows from virtue. ... More »LEADERS FAIL TO CURB CASINO CAPITALISM OBAMA IS BEST CANDIDATE TO FACE CHANGING WORLDGeorgie Anne Geyer - Thu, Nov 1, 2012CHICAGO -- Some lucky star was blinking over me in the unbelievable hours that a strangely tepid full moon was hanging languidly over the East Coast this week. By chance, I was in my hometown of Chicago when -- of all things! -- a tropical hurricane savaged the Northeast and brought acres of January snow to West Virginia in October.As Mitt Romney said perceptively on one of his campaign stops during the storm, "I don't think there has been a hurricane in Ohio in a long time."For me, as much as I hate to say it, these last few days have been lovely. ...

His people loved him, and he loved champagne, beautiful women and his people, too. His life, however, was doomed, because it seemed that everyone in the world wanted to destroy his little country.Yet, when Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk died in Beijing earlier this month, even those who criticized or reviled him had to admit that he was quite a guy. ... More »AN ERA PASSES IN CAMBODIADEBATES REVEAL SHIFTING VIEWS, SHIFTING PERSONALITIESGeorgie Anne Geyer - Tue, Oct 23, 2012WASHINGTON -- What a strange campaign season this has been, the Year of Our Lord 2012!During the first presidential debate, we wondered who would get the dubious pleasure of waking up President Obama before the 90 minutes had passed, or who would tell him to stop nodding in agreement with Mitt Romney, the man he was supposed to be in a white heat to beat.In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden was so hyper it seemed as though someone had plugged him into an electrical outlet. He was so busy making up for sleepy Obama that he all but "a-ha'ed" Paul Ryan into an abnormal calm. ... More »DEBATES REVEAL SHIFTING VIEWS, SHIFTING PERSONALITIESTHE STORY OF BENGHAZI IS STILL UNFOLDINGGeorgie Anne Geyer - Thu, Oct 18, 2012WASHINGTON -- No one was really surprised when the two candidates at the second presidential debate ended up arguing about security in faraway Benghazi, where beloved American ambassador Christopher Stevens and three aides were killed this 9/11 by terrorists. But at the bottom of the argument, there remained a strangely unanswered question.From the beginning of the debate, it was obvious that President Obama would defend his administration's wavering over whether the attack and fire were actually a "terrorist" attack. ... More »THE STORY OF BENGHAZI IS STILL UNFOLDINGEUROPE'S 'HOUSE OF PEACE' DESERVES ITS PRIZEGeorgie Anne Geyer - Mon, Oct 15, 2012WASHINGTON -- Watching with special joy over the weekend as the European Union -- known in the neighborly "new Europe" simply as the E.U. -- was awarded the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize, my thoughts returned to three special moments in my life:-- During the early 1990s, when the Serbs' modern-day SS troops were rampaging through what had been Yugoslavia, savagely destroying everything and everybody in their wake, I would often stop in Brussels at the office of the NATO secretary-general, Manfred Woerner, the suave, handsome German peacemaker.That day he started to reminisce, passionately. ... More »EUROPE'S 'HOUSE OF PEACE' DESERVES ITS PRIZETHIRTEEN DAYS IN OCTOBERGeorgie Anne Geyer - Mon, Oct 1, 2012WASHINGTON -- So now we are already into October, the month when the presidential campaigns go wild or drop from exhaustion. It is the historical month of political surprises. We forget sometimes that it is also one of the most beautiful months in America, or that this year it is a month that tells us rather more than we want to know about nuclear showmanship. ... More »THIRTEEN DAYS IN OCTOBERCANDIDATES BEGIN TO GRUDGINGLY ACKNOWLEDGE FOREIGN AFFAIRSGeorgie Anne Geyer - Thu, Sep 27, 2012WASHINGTON -- In every presidential campaign, the theme at the beginning of the race rings out with the same words: Americans are interested only in matters at home! Who would be interested in Myanmar, whatever or wherever that might be? Look, Buster, we've got economic problems here -- is your brother working? And you, Missy --- how long since YOU had a job?China? Well, sure it's big, and it's somewhere near Myanmar, isn't it? Those Chinese were very good at building railroads out West, and they excelled at laundries. ...

It's a tragic tale. Maybe you should drop off now.But the story of Ambassador Christopher Stevens in Benghazi on Sept. 11 is more than a tale told by madmen. It rings with the singular mourning that has swept unusual portions of the world following this fine young man's death. ...

(Well, almost.) Disappeared to some new zoological park are those yet-unshaped voices that dared to challenge the "Charging Bull" statue of Wall Street. (Well, sort of.)Out of sight now, the tents and the "revolutionary" romances, thrown together in the throes of the movement that would change America forever. ... More »REVOLUTIONS WITHOUT RESULTSHARD TRUTHS ARE LEARNED HARD WAY IN MIDDLE EASTGeorgie Anne Geyer - Mon, Sep 17, 2012WASHINGTON -- When the brutal attacks on 9/11 happened 11 years ago, there was an overwhelming mystery about them. Why would anyone do this to US? There was also a singularity about them, as though this was one attack, out of nowhere, meant to signify nothing except hatred of the United States. There was almost an accidental quality about the whole thing.Soon, we got a name for the group behind the attack -- al-Qaida -- and we went after it mostly in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. ... More »HARD TRUTHS ARE LEARNED HARD WAY IN MIDDLE EASTMAKING SENSE OF NEW REALITIES IN MIDEAST IS GREAT CHALLENGEGeorgie Anne Geyer - Thu, Sep 13, 2012WASHINGTON -- One of the great dangers of these last few days -- as American embassy after consulate after legation is brutally attacked in the Middle East -- is simply how easy it is for any wild-eyed fool to throw the entire world into terror.Any simpering idiot can take a picture of the Prophet Muhammad and make it look like Genghis Khan, Al Capone or a headhunter from the jungle. ...

Also, it is a big book, published in 1970; that probably meant that no intellectual smart-aleck friend of mine would argue with me about it.I settled in. ...

And now?"Why health care, during his first year, when it blotted out issues such as saving the economy? It still is a mystery to many, but Maryland's impressive Gov.  ...

Yet in the few days between the two party conventions, something revealing was occurring in Afghanistan. ...

I am supposed to wring my hands and whimper (whimpering always helps) that this was nonsense and I regret my infantile foolishness. ...

Dad came up on Sundays, after working hard at his dairy to give us "the lake."Wisconsin, you see, was more than a neighboring state. Wisconsin was the place to have fun. Once you crossed the border, you were free, a state of mind true Wisconsinites were not always enamored of. All the inhibitions lay behind, in the ashes of our parents', schools' and churches' dutiful admonitions. ...

For that is what the Ryan program is all about. ...

That was where he questioned whether the English Olympic Games of this summer were as well-planned as his Salt Lake City Winter Games in 2002.But the real dangers of the overseas jaunt -- and that seemed to be what it was because it came across as so random and purposeless -- lay somewhere else. ...

Her regular schedule resumes with the release for Aug. 7.WASHINGTON -- Few Americans, even those who are familiar with the treacherous Russian landscape, know the amazing city of Kazan. It sits not quite all the way to the Ural Mountains from Moscow and is one of the most beautiful cities in the former Soviet Union. Kazan sits along the upper "Mother Volga" in Tatarstan, with a stunning white Kremlin built by Ivan the Terrible atop a hill where he could watch the river. ...

Residents are browned from the sun or ruddy from skiing. Colorado has always been a center of good health and outdoor activity.It's the kind of place where, on a summer's eve, young people would get their best friends together and go to a movie -- a favorite American pastime. ...

When approached by a stranger, they often ran in fright. One night in the elegantly refurbished old Strand Hotel, my effort to send an email to my office was the signal for everyone in the lobby to freeze in place.Outside, the streets, which had not changed since the British were in South Asia, were silent. Booksellers did not speak. ...

It was a sight that never bored us.In the kind months, when Lake Michigan was all shades of blue, Chicagoans could not get enough of the lake's wonders. We thought our city was beautiful -- but I have to say that in those years, even at its best, it was a tough, gritty, gray city of steel mills, Mafia hit men, and a river that we had somehow made run backward. ...

The people weren't funny like the Egyptians, they weren't beautiful like the original Arabs of the Arabian peninsula, and if they knew how to gracefully sail boats like the Tunisians, surely they never showed it.Then when the glassy-eyed Moammar Gadhafi left the desert tent in which he had been raised in the vast expanses of Cyrenaica and Tripoli and ruled over Libya for 42 dark years, the country became even crazier. ...

The original Yankee Doodle Dandy was, of course, George M.

Even odder is why they would be critical of the part of Obamacare that requires everyone to have health insurance.It would seem that we have gotten the legal part of the fight more-or-less solved: Those who persist in not getting health insurance will not have to pay a fine under our interstate commerce conventions, but instead, a "tax" under our abundant tax regulations.

Kennedy in 1963 -- never comes to any rational conclusion. The questions have remained so devilishly unanswered for so long that most Americans don't waste much time on them any longer.But every once in a while, someone pops up out of nowhere with another piece of the puzzle.

Bush. The title was, not surprisingly, "41." The program was somehow comforting, with lots of time for him to talk, in his charming mixture of upper-crust East Coast and funny slang.

Like an inexorable wind of transformation, it swept across the deserts of western Arabia. The "ancien regime" of Mubarak, father and sons, was disgraced, the Islamists were abidingly distrusted, and only the Egyptian military retained the confidence of the people.In Tahrir Square, the military largely kept order and the Egyptians covered them with flowers. ...

No lesser an interest group than the United Nations did so -- and the White House followed up with the same denominator of danger.

With his Memorial Day speech finally giving some respect to the long-forgotten Vietnam veterans, he seemed to be resetting history, inserting important parts that were left out the first time around.Speaking to thousands of Vietnam vets and others before the shiny black granite wall of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial here, with its incised names of the dead, President Obama tried to fill in what should have been said decades ago. ...

Men fought the wars, said "I do" to Uncle Sam posters pointing at YOU, while women "kept the home fires burning."But, ahhh, things do change. Slowly at first, over the last two generations, American women began "going to war" in Pentagon offices. Today, they are sharing most jobs except combat with the men.

Then he would add sadly, "If you newspaper people had any money, we'd put it in JPMorgan Chase."Well, perhaps this week marks the first time "we newspaper people" are damned lucky that we don't have any money to invest in the country's largest bank, with its 260,000 employees and its losses in the first half of the year moving from $2 billion to $3 billion. ...

Telling ABC News that "same-sex couples should be able to get married" because all Americans should be treated equally, Obama's surprising words came only days after Joe Biden's jolting ones, with everybody thinking he was undercutting his president.This change marks perhaps the most difficult and sobering change in American thinking and law in decades. ...

"He'll certainly be captured in the next few days and he should be brought to trial by the Libyans.""Oooh NO!" I said, in one of my more intractable vocal tones.

And, yes, I suppose that $250 million is a lot to have for a man who apparently can't afford an extra car to carry his dog. But the predominant criticism -- that "Mittens," as they call him on the press bus, can't "feel our pain" because of his money -- is about as insipid as it gets.We don't need a president to feel our pain.

Underneath the surface, an increasingly worried "conversation" has been going on in the region's newspapers and among the Arab intelligentsia.To oversimplify, the concern is growing rapidly that, led by Syria, much of the Middle East is essentially forsaking its colonially imposed borders and devolving into its original historical forms.Writing recently in the Daily Star in Beirut, Michael Young, the paper's opinion editor, expressed the idea that this would take the form of "ethnic statelets. ...

Most observers expected Egypt and Tunisia, which exploded a year ago this month against their dictators, to have by now reached some level of stability.

President Obama and his team have been quietly building a new narrative and structure for America that should outlast his years in office.Until the last few months, it has been possible to wonder if Barack Obama and his stirring admonition of "Yes, we can" were failing.

Endless sessions on the theme entered the economic and political parlance and seemed to the elites and to the free thinkers to be the world's salvation.It used to be that globalization was an idea no person in his or her right mind would think of challenging. It was so good, so right; it was the moral answer to the globe's economic inequities.  ...

There, they bewildered salespeople for a few minutes, dancing around, and then they disbanded.In San Francisco that same year, a flash mob, organized through email and online forums, gathered in Dolores Park, and at exactly 2:07 p.m., leapt to their feet and formed giant standing circles, holding hands as they danced for 10 minutes before running off as unexpectedly as they ran in. ...

The story also seemed to involve "status of forces" agreements, which means that American troops can never be submitted to judgment under foreign judges or claimants.But I'm not certain, because just as I thought I heard this dramatic bit of news on TV, it was past, and Herman Cain and his problems came on.

It stands grandly for the arts and introduces them to all comers.But this amazing opera house, the first among the Gulf states and only the third in the entire Arab world after the declining and nearly forgotten ones of Cairo and Damascus, has immeasurable other purposes that could, with any luck at all, enliven this rich and potentially happy region in the future. ...

the federal gov. wants the states to expand healthcare. the fed will pay for it for 3 years and then dump it on the states. If the states dont expand it the insurance companies will be taxed over 3 percent in which they will pass that down to the hospitals which they also wont pay for it so it is finally passed down to the Patients.YOU AND ME. congradulations everyday you learn more shit about obamacare.

makes sense since its in the bible that syria, iran,turkey, coalition, plus Magog(Russia) will invade israel.

HA america didnt vote for a president, they voted for a supposed Santa Clause. Funny after he got re-elected businesses and corporations commited to mass layoffs. In polls many had specific questions such as whos better for the economy and jobs, most picked romney but still chose obama(SANTA CLAUSE). now you have mass layoffs and people full time now partime. congradulations for voting for a man who failed his promises in the first term and now doesnt have an incintive bc no need to be reelected

This can actually make sense why obama was re-elected. In the Bible israel will be invaded by Iran,Russia, turkey, syria, and a coalition after they have resettled in their own﻿ land(which has already been fulfilled when the jews took back their land in the mid 1940s). The Bible says that(bc America is isreals western ally) the US will be unable or unwilling to defend israel. Israel must stand alone with God and her enemies will be destroyed unexplainably. I say this bc obama is loose on Israel.

hehe now you have Obamacare which business cant afford which mass layoffs began 2 days ago. Obamacare inevitably raises taxes on the middleclass. Yep america voted for santa clause. Romey want to get you to get off your ass and work while obama wants to sit back and hand you a check. problem is whos paying for it? Taxing the rich will only run the country at best under 11 months. So should we tax our way to prosperity which has never worked?

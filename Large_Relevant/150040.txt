Well, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Linus Torvalds were nerds. When you've achieved more success then them, come back and say this again.

Oh, by the way, I hope you're using your own non-nerd software, as Windows, Mac and Linux came from Nerds.

People like you make others happy; at least we know that there's someone more retarded than the average person. :D

Very nice. I have a few questions. 

Where's the washing machine and dryer though? Another thing is that it wouldn't it be good to isolate your kitchen from the rest of your house, as this would prevent the smells from cooking and especially frying from lingering in your living space? Lastly, wouldn't black would be a better colour than white, given how easy it is for it to discolour in let's say 3 years time. 

Great job overall though.

Totally agree. It's funny how people that review ebook readers lack common sense, considering that reading should increase your intelligence.

If they wanted to be totally professional, they could have invested in a lumen meter for the measuring of the min/max brightness levels objectively. After which, they could adjust ALL of the screens to have the same lumen level instead of having a Kobo lightbulb.

Japan faces nuclear shutdown for second time since FukushimaBy Aaron Sheldrick | Reuters – Thu, Jan 24, 2013

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan may face a total nuclear shutdown in the summer for the second time since the March 2011 Fukushima disaster as the country's two operating reactors close for maintenance and tough new safety checks keep the rest of the fleet offline.
              That could force Japan to import even more fossil fuels for power generation, adding to an onerous energy bill that helped push the country into a record trade deficit in 2012.
              "It is unlikely that any of the idled reactors will re-start prior to September due to ongoing investigations of seismic issues at certain plants and due to the fact that safety standards have still not been finalized by the Nuclear Regulation Authority," said Tom O'Sullivan, a Tokyo-based energy consultant.
              "Local approvals will also be necessary for re-starts, adding a further layer of complication," he said.
              The previous Democratic Party of Japan government's decision last June to restart two reactors weeks after the last full shutdown galvanized the country's previously dormant anti-nuclear movement, sparking the biggest demonstrations in decades and contributing to its downfall in elections in December.
              Media surveys have shown a majority of Japanese want to abandon atomic energy by 2030, if not sooner, making the decision to restart even reactors deemed safe a risky proposition for the new Liberal Democratic Party government.
              Utilities and the government, however, are keen to reduce expensive oil and gas imports. Japan is already the world's top liquefied natural gas (LNG) importer, and volumes rose 11.2 percent to a record 87.31 million metric tons in 2012 from a year earlier, according to government data. That is more than one third of global trade of about 240 million metric tons in LNG in 2011.
              Crude oil imports rose 2 percent in 2012 to 3.66 million barrels a day, from a 22-year low in 2011. Thermal coal imports were up 6.5 percent to 107.7 million metric tons.
              The NRA, set up in September last year with more independence than its predecessor, this week released a draft of tough new rules that nuclear operators must comply with to get reactors approved for restart. These may delay any restarts further. The NRA say it will finalize the safety standards by July.
              "In terms of earthquakes and tsunamis, I'm sure our safety standards will be the toughest in the world," NRA chief Shunichi Tanaka said at a regular news conference on Wednesday.
              Tanaka earlier warned the government its three-year deadline to carry out safety checks of reactors is too ambitious.
              The only two of Japan's 50 nuclear plants operating are both at Kansai Electric Power's Ohi plant in western Japan, and must be for shut for maintenance 13 months after resuming commercial operations, according to Japanese law.
              That means they will be idled by the middle of September, according to Kansai Electric spokesman Takahiro Senoh.
              The Fukushima disaster, the worst nuclear accident in the world in a quarter century, prompted the gradual shutdown of all Japan's nuclear reactors until there were none left operating in May 2012, leaving the country without atomic power for the first time since 1970.

Germany is producing 25% of their power with renewables right now. Much higher % next year. Japan has more potential with all their coastline prime for windmills and tidal power, and their hot earth underneath [ring of fire] for geothermal. Just like Iceland, they could produce more power than they use in a short period of time if they invest.

Alanm, The Japanese are working on it.    The newest designs have shown entire high rises being constructed in solar sensitive panels.  If any nation is going to figure it out,  it will be them.

In the piece that I am writing re US naval power in the 1970s, data would indicate trhat  a
project a third of the size of peak WWII production could be built for approx  one-fourhundredth of US national energy consumption--doable even in an era of energy crisis, for which the 1970s  became  notorious .

One wrong move and japan could be unlivable for 1000 years 
Playing with extinction is something only humans are dumb enough to do.

We have a brilliant Sun. An all powerful source of God created energy. Surely in this day & age we can find a way to harvest that almighty energy into a reliable energy source thus eliminating dangerous nuclear alternatives!

For power, we can do better, but the problem is, as always MONEY!
Those making money from oil or nuke power will not give it up without a fight.
And since they have a very large amount of money, they will use it to keep 
anything else from coming into existence.

Tokyo is due for a massive earthquake. Shutting down these nuclear plants is a good idea.

The "toughest" does not prevent nature from taking them down.  Alternate fuels systems are the way to go - the use of "tidal electricity", the gyroscopes are tied together and rest on the sea, turning by the tide, generating electricity - there is so much better to do.
     The US is facing the same thing in Moscow, Idaho, which nobody wants to talk about? reactors right in the middle of our "watershed for the West"? what are they thinking? the fiendish attempt to "prove they are able to control the world?", but they can't and someday Idaho will be looking like Japan?  

     God save all of us from these physists who insist they have a "priesthood" that is insane, they cannot communicate successfully with the rest of the world and want to "hide" the same way the "Manhattan Group" did - can't do it.

     I hope Japan has some "chips to call in" in Korea? and convince them to give the "nuke" back to the United States, where it came from in the 1980's.  The attempt to use it against the United States? like a pit bull cornered?  Yes, pit bulls are scary things, but one good shot to the head? and they are no more?

     If the Korean "nuke" accidently blows as they fake knowledge they do not have - using a bomb now 33 years old? buggy bumpers? too?

     The megaton level of it?  Why don't people discuss this?  We should have all the "stats" on this bomb? we gave it to them!

     I say, a complete embargo to -0- - no food, fuels, - induce them to just "give it back".

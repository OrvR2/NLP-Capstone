 Louis Cruises is introducing a new faith-based travel cruise program takes travelers to explore destinations rich in history and religious significance sailing on a Mediterranean cruise to exciting ports including Thessaloniki and Kavala in Greece; then cruising on to Istanbul, Dikili, Kusadasi in Turkey; before heading to Patmos and Syros in Greece; then back to Athens where the itinerary commences.Miami, FL (PRWEB) January 31, 2013  LOUIS CRUISES, the leader in 3, 4 and 7 day Greek Islands and Turkey cruises, is pleased to unveil an exciting new cruise itinerary, introduced under the name “Pilgrimage Voyages” that invites travelers to share a voyage of religious discovery to Thessaloniki, Kavala, Istanbul, Dikili, Ancient Ephesus, Patmos, and Syros – locations holding strong relationships with history and Christianity. 
The scheduled departures of the 7-day cruise itinerary “Pilgrimage Voyages” include: October 18th and October 25th of 2013. Sailing from the port of Lavrion in Athens, Greece, this faith-based travel cruise program takes travelers to explore destinations rich in history and religious significance starting with Thessaloniki and Kavala in Greece; then cruising on to Istanbul, Dikili, Kusadasi in Turkey; before heading to Patmos and Syros in Greece; then back to Athens. 
In Thessaloniki, travelers will visit the ancient walls, the House of Jason and the Agora before delving into Veria.  Next it's on to tour Kavala (biblical Neapolis), Philippi and the Baptistery of Lydia. Participants will enjoy a worship service on the river where Paul's first European convert, Lydia, was baptized. In Istanbul, pilgrims will explore Hagia Sofia, Topkapi Palace and the Blue Mosque. The next stop on this inspired faith-based travel program is Dikili where travelers will discover the treasures of Pergamon.  Visitors will experience Ancient Ephesus in Kusadasi and take-in the spiritual peace at House of Virgin Mary. Patmos awaits as the next cruise port to reveal its imposing history with visits to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites: The Monastery of St. John the Theologian and the Cave of the Apocalypse where St. John the Divine dictated the Christian scriptural Book of Revelation.
“It has been nearly 2000 years since the Apostle Paul set out from the Holy Land on a journey that was to play an immeasurable role in the dissemination of Christian ideas and the establishment of Christian communities. This cruise itinerary offers a rare opportunity for all those interested in the history of the Christian faith to relive parts of Apostle Paul's journey, and literally follow in his footsteps,” said Nicholas Filippidis, Director of Product Development in North America for Louis Cruises.
The sense of fulfillment and understanding acquired from participating in this soul searching, eye-opening cruise tour cannot be acquired from books or movies, to actually follow the journey of the Apostle Paul, on the paths that he took, to view the archeological sights and relive his life in your heart and soul is a blessed educational faith-based travel tour.

This nightclub was crowded, it had just 1 exit door, no fire alarm, the fire extinguishers were not enough, there was no sparkling system or fire scapes either.
The fire was caused by a pyrotechnics display igniting exposed overhead sound insulation. The ceiling caught fire quickly and in seconds a dark thick smoke was everywhere. People could not see the exit door and most of them died﻿ by asfyxia trying to get out. Most victims were between 18 and 22 y.o.
Let's pray for them and their families

I'm Brazilian, here everything is solved through corruption ... The most responsible﻿ for this tragedy is the public power.

These young, dumb, and full of﻿ ... brazilians think it's cool to let their guard down and pack a nightclub of 1000 capacity persons with 2000 people. Then one of these jokers gets the bright idea of lighting pyrotechniques inside this masterpiece of disaster and they all act surprised when in the﻿ panic, 245 people die burning and screaming and getting trampled by the same people they were dancing and fucking just minutes ago. Darwinism at it's finest.

Here in Brazil is being so difficult to keep going with life routine when something so terrible happened last night. Even who lives far from the tragedy,﻿ we, parents of teenagers and young people are feeling even more devastated. What a terrible way to die. It was an extermination. Reminds the Holocaust.

I don't know in the rest of the world, but here on Brazil we are to used to think "it will never happen", so a guy start a business like this, he won't think about emergency exits, springers or keeping fire extinguishers up to date, he will only think about it when he is forced to,﻿ because of our way of thinking, why spend money and effort in something that will never happen... then it happen and there's the result...

Luke 13:2-5
Jesus said: “Do you think those Galileans were worse sinners than all the other people from Galilee? Jesus asked. Is that why they suffered? Not at all! & you will perish too, unless you repent of your sins & turn to God & what about the eighteen people who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them? Were they the worst sinners in Jerusalem? No, & I tell you again that﻿ unless you repent, you will perish, too”

Luke 13:6-9
Jesus said: “A man planted a fig tree in his garden & came again & again to see if there was any fruit on it, but he was always disappointed. Finally, he said to his gardener, I’ve waited three years & there hasn’t been a single fig! Cut it down. It’s just taking up space in the garden. The gardener answered, Sir, give it one more chance. Leave it another year & I’ll give it special attention & plenty of fertilizer. If we get figs﻿ next year, fine. If not, then you can cut it down”

Another tragic event after the two fires which broke in Karachi factories killing over 300 people a few months ago.In both cases it seems no fire risk assessment to determine the requirements of fire safety and adherence to those requirements﻿ were undertaken.My deepest sympathy from Indian Ocean island of Mauritius.

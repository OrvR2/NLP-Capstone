Idaho Inmates Sue Beer, Wine Companies for $1B

Idaho Department of Corrections
Five Idaho inmates  are blaming alcohol for the crimes that put them in prison and are suing some of the nation’s top liquor and wine companies for $1 billion.
Keith Allen Brown, Steven Thompson, Woodrow Grant, Cory Baugh and Jeremy Brown all claim that alcohol led them to their crimes and they should have been warned of the beverages’ addictive nature.
“If I was not an alcoholic, the shooting would never have happened,” Jeremy Brown said in his affidavit. Brown, 34, is serving a 20- to 30-year sentence for a 2001 shooting that seriously injured a man.
The plaintiffs’ crimes range from manslaughter to grand theft. They are currently serving time at Idaho’s Kuna facility.
Their lawsuit, filed in Boise’s U.S. District Court last month, targets eight defendants, including Anheuser-Busch, Coors, Miller Brewing and the owner of Jim Beam whiskey, American Brands. The inmates claim the companies are responsible for their crimes and should have put warning labels on their products.
“I have spent a great deal of that time in prison because of situations that have arose because of people being drunk, or because of situations in which alcohol played a major role,” Jeremy Brown said in his affidavit. “At no time in my life, prior to me becoming an alcoholic, was I ever informed that alcohol was habit forming and addictive.”
Keith Brown is serving a 15-year prison sentence after shooting a man to death five years ago. Baugh and Thompson are both serving 3 to 7-years for grand theft and drug convictions. And Grant is serving up to 7-years for drug and aggravated battery convictions.
All five men share the same story about booze.
“I fear the day I am released from prison,” Grant, 27, said in his affidavit. “I do not know if I can be a productive member of society and still control the desires and craving to use alcohol.”
The inmates do not have an attorney, but Boise attorney Joe Filicetti told ABC News affiliate KIVI that alcohol addiction and it’s side effects are pretty common knowledge.
“If you put these guys through depositions and you ask them ‘What do you know about alcohol?’ I think it’s pretty common knowledge that it’s addictive,” Filicetti told KIVI. “It’s well known to be addictive. It’s well known to be something that causes you to reduce your inhibitions and to do things you otherwise wouldn’t do.”
The beer and wine companies have not responded to ABC News for comment.

Oh really!!!!!???? what about personal responsibility/????? grow up and accept the consequences of your poor choices…..these inmates are using the system (not to mention abusing it)  AAAAARRRRGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

“please drink responsibly” a.k.a dont drink at all!




			Posted by: khan | January 3, 2013, 2:39 pm 2:39 pm		



Can I sue them for wasting taxpayer dollars?




			Posted by: NoSpin1600 | January 3, 2013, 2:39 pm 2:39 pm		



That’s why these morons are in jail now — NOT TAKING PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY.  I hope the judge gives this frivolous lawsuit the attention it deserves.  Put it in the “circular file.”




			Posted by: MsT-Mac | January 3, 2013, 2:45 pm 2:45 pm		



If they succeed then I’m filing suit too!




			Posted by: Ken | January 3, 2013, 2:47 pm 2:47 pm		



Hummm, seems to me – if anyone needs to file lawsuit, they should consider file one against their own individual parents because had their parents made the right choice not to have each one of them, then none of them would even exist and thus none of them would be where they are now. Of course, they could file lawsuits against the schools, teachers, Administrators…etc – after all, this is a free country and BTW who’s going to put a stop to this kind of frivolous lawsuits anyway? But everything should start with their own parents.

Until I’d read this article I thought I’d heard it all….sheese!

The worst part is some Libard judge will probably give it to them!

Apparently having lot’s of time to sit and think about things doesn’t help the mentally challenged…




			Posted by: Deepwater805 | January 3, 2013, 2:57 pm 2:57 pm		



this is about the dumbest thing that i have ever heard off, thats like some jerk setting his hs on fire with his family in it and there sueing the gas company for him being able to buy the gas that started the fire!  they r right where they belong, locked up with other stupid people!

Just shoot all of them and put them out of society’s misery.




			Posted by: vet2be | January 3, 2013, 3:00 pm 3:00 pm		



One guy kills a man and gets 15 years. Another wounds a man and gets 20-30 years? Another fears the day he’s released from prison? I got a solution to that fear- don’t leave prison.




			Posted by: JJ Cooley | January 3, 2013, 3:06 pm 3:06 pm		



Wow.  That is pretty…sad.  The thing is, since we’re seeing about the lawsuit it means some mentally challenged judge has already let it get initiated instead of slapping these buttwipes in the face and telling them ‘NO SOUP FER JOU!!’




			Posted by: David | January 3, 2013, 3:16 pm 3:16 pm		



What nonsense.   Hopefully the lawsuit will be tossed quickly and with extreme prejudice.




			Posted by: KlangenFarben | January 3, 2013, 3:17 pm 3:17 pm		



Serve them some special kool aid in prison




			Posted by: Terry | January 3, 2013, 3:19 pm 3:19 pm		



Let them sue that’s fine but if they loose they have to stay in prison untill the court fees are paid off at the same rate of pay that the get for sitting in prison.




			Posted by: Going Coastal | January 3, 2013, 3:23 pm 3:23 pm		



These guys are dorks along the lines of the dumb bimbo caught on camera texting and falling into a fountain… if you hadn’t been so eager to make money and bring a lawsuit resulting in TV coverage, no one would have known who you are. You should all be embarrassed and ashamed.




			Posted by: ImeMine63 | January 3, 2013, 3:23 pm 3:23 pm		



Stupid is as stupid does. There is a reason these men are in prison…….they are not smart men.




			Posted by: Forrest | January 3, 2013, 3:35 pm 3:35 pm		



They should sue the gun makers too, if there wasn’t a gun it wouldn’t have happened. And their parents, if they were not born this would never have happened. Stupid idiots, I hope they die in prison.




			Posted by: darthzavros | January 3, 2013, 3:36 pm 3:36 pm		



this made me laugh so hard, i had tears running down my leg




			Posted by: Dee | January 3, 2013, 3:42 pm 3:42 pm		



Really???  Can I sue them for child support because there was no warning label that said “May Cause Pregnancy?”    
I agree with KHAN.




			Posted by: Mar | January 3, 2013, 3:51 pm 3:51 pm		



Maybe the lawyers and judges who allow these friviolous lawsuits to hit the court system pay for them?  I mean, if they knew they were going to be bringing crap to the courts and if they failed they’d have to pay for them they might stop putting this crap into our judicial system.




			Posted by: David | January 3, 2013, 3:52 pm 3:52 pm		



Are we dealing with morons? Who told them to drink to the point that they would commit crimes, their mother? What a waste of taxpayer’s money. You can bet some idiot lawyer is thinking, how much money can I make before I loose this case. Jeremy Brown says“I have spent a great deal of that time in prison because of situations that have arose because of people being drunk, or because of situations in which alcohol played a major role. At no time in my life, prior to me becoming an alcoholic, was I ever informed that alcohol was habit forming and addictive.” Is this guy talking from the bottom of a glass? Funniest story I have read in a long time.

I know when I have 2 or 3 coors lights the temptation to shoot people and rob liquor stores is overwhelming!




			Posted by: Jason | January 3, 2013, 3:58 pm 3:58 pm		



This is just an extension of the “it isn’t my fault syndrome”, criminals almost always blame somebody else (often times the victim) for their actions. It is a common trait of psychopaths.




			Posted by: Fernando Alvarado | January 3, 2013, 3:58 pm 3:58 pm		



This is crazy! Besides, it only takes one night to ruin your life or someone else’s! I’m not an alcoholic, but whose fault would it be if I drove drunk tonight and killed someone? It’s all about being responsible!




			Posted by: Trisha | January 3, 2013, 4:02 pm 4:02 pm		



This extream stupidity comes from a few sorces. First, prisons are too comfortable, how do you commit violent crimes and in most cases live better in prison than they did outside. Second our Judicial system allows these obvious frivolous cases to be filed in the first place, there needs to be a screening process in order to keep the valid separate from the obvious BS. Thirdly, I think it was mentioned earlier, can we sue them for making us support them in prison? Lastly, can we hold the parents of these idiots responsible for dumping trash onto society? I’m Just saying!!!




			Posted by: Reggie53 | January 3, 2013, 4:11 pm 4:11 pm		



Sure, why not!!  If you can sue and get millions from big tobacco, why not for booze which is equally addictive.  Some liberal judge will view it like that and open a whole can of worms.  And with this new world view create by Obamanites of getting what you can, while you can, especially from the wealthy and big corporations, why the heck not.  I’m jealous I didn’t think of it first.  Just obtain a good liberal lawyer and the world is your oyster, even behind bars.




			Posted by: Gunner--59 | January 3, 2013, 4:16 pm 4:16 pm		



Personal responsibility these days has obviously gone out the window!  Think about it:  People wanting to sue McDonald’s for their obesity – or spilling hot coffee of themselves; criminals suing their victims because of injury sustained (from victim or someone coming to their defense) while they committed their crime.  The list goes on and on and the excuses are endless.  Enough already!




			Posted by: makemyday2day | January 3, 2013, 4:23 pm 4:23 pm		



And who is paying the filing fees, deposition cost and attorney’s fees?




			Posted by: nevada mike | January 3, 2013, 4:25 pm 4:25 pm		



This just goes in the file with many other examples of law suits with no merit.  The sad part is that quite a few of the earlier cases in that file were successful for the plaintiffs.  Is this really any more ludicrous than many of the other successful cases?




			Posted by: NMPete | January 3, 2013, 4:26 pm 4:26 pm		



They can sue themselves for making the choice of drinking. Aren’t we all tired of people who make wrong choices (like drinking, smoking, having irresponsible secs) and then blame everyone else for the repercussions?




			Posted by: Jiji Moran | January 3, 2013, 4:28 pm 4:28 pm		



so.. let me get this streight.. some guys are sueing beer/wine companys because the drink “made” them do it.. and yall say they are abusing the system. serriously not one of you is standing up for them. so in that logic.. blaming a gun for a crime is the same thing? do you not see the corilation of the two? that the liquor didnt make them do these crimes.. personal responcibility and lack of personal acountability is the reason.. 2cents.. WAKE UP TO REALITY.

“I fear the day I am released from prison,” Grant, 27, said in his affidavit – I also fear the day he is released….we have enough stupid walkng around amongst the general public – we certainly do not need one more.

Sure!  Colt 45 aficionados will read the warning labels. LOL!




			Posted by: Ernesto | January 3, 2013, 5:36 pm 5:36 pm		



Man, I just hate it when those companies catch me and pour alcohol down my throat. I try to maintain sobriety, but they set me up. Oh wait! that is not what happens.

BULL—-!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!




			Posted by: Eric | January 3, 2013, 5:44 pm 5:44 pm		



When they lose the suit, or it is tossed, the lawyer should be sentenced for gross stupidity and wasting the courts time.  If they did that for all stupid frivolous suits, maybe stupid lawyers would quit looking for a payout.




			Posted by: Laffin' Atcha | January 3, 2013, 6:12 pm 6:12 pm		



At any time, did the makers of alcohol force these guys to drink any of their products? Isn’t this where freedom of choice comes into play? Looks like they made the wrong choice!

The 5 inmates aren’t being stupid at all. They have less cell and yard time while working on their lawsuit. That’s far from stupid. But it is indeed ridiculous that the system, as it stands right now, permits such nonsense. The term “prison reform” now needs a new slant.




			Posted by: Jim | January 4, 2013, 5:26 am 5:26 am		



How much time and money has been wasted so far on this?  These men should have to repay every penny that has been wasted thus far.  Who okayed this travesty?  To even respond to these claims is utter stupidity.  The claim they should be making is to get the proper medical care that our prison system does not supply.  Rehabilitation is not just for rich drug addicts.




			Posted by: mamasnothappy | January 4, 2013, 7:49 am 7:49 am		



So true, IMO, there are a lot of stupid out there, and we voted for some of them, hell I use to get drunk go to jail, get out go to work, still smoking, but not drnking over 25 yearts now,smoking more addictive, but not causing me to go to jail yet. I think they will get what they deserve, the rest of their sentence, and kicked loose.

Can I sue the US govt because I got arrested for drugs because the failed to keep them from coming across the border?




			Posted by: brian | January 4, 2013, 11:20 am 11:20 am		



Gross stupidity should be a capital offense.




			Posted by: Stano | January 4, 2013, 12:28 pm 12:28 pm		



Ok this is more then obvious these ignorants are trying to rip off the companies. And the attorney is entirely right. Alcohol is addictive. Seriously who dosent know that? If someone dosent know that especially some grown then they seriously need to. And need to get some help, especially if one is fearing they wont be able to control their cravings. Haha. I couldnt believe this and still cant. What a laugh.




			Posted by: Codeman | January 4, 2013, 1:15 pm 1:15 pm		



And there really is no need for a warning label. Thats just stupid. I dont think there should be a warning label with cigarettes either. Who doesnt know cigarettes kill? Same situation there.




			Posted by: Codeman | January 4, 2013, 1:19 pm 1:19 pm		



I am glad to see that guns are not the only inanimate object’s that are being blamed for other people’s crimes.  I have been waiting years for some one to sue the car manufacturer’s for the drunk driver’s crime.  lol




			Posted by: NVHunter | January 4, 2013, 2:54 pm 2:54 pm		



Thus the goal is to make alcohol illegal again?  Because if they win billions, then all of society has an excuse to commit crimes and abuses and blame it on alcohol use.  They can be committed to a psych ward for their inability to face responsibility.  Not all drinkers, even alcholics, kill and rob.  What makes these guys different is their mental state, obviously never safe to be released into public again.




			Posted by: GHS4u | January 4, 2013, 4:30 pm 4:30 pm		



only in america could convicted felons sue alcohol companies for billions over something like this before congress would ever pass stricter gun laws.




			Posted by: Chris | January 4, 2013, 4:57 pm 4:57 pm		



This has got to be a joke!  Seriously, blame everyone and everything else for your own lack of responsibility.  Ignorance is bliss!  And who is flipping the bill for this lawsuit???  Lets just eliminate your privileges as you have eliminated the privileges of others in your desire to be intoxicated or on drugs, oh wait lets sue the drug dealers too for making you take that crap too!  We know none of the illegal narcotics come with a warning sign!  And better yet us paying for you to take up space doing nothing but trying to blame others for your wrong doing, maybe you need to get busy getting a job in jail and learning to control your addicitive personalities so if you are allowed out, you’ll be able to make a better person out of yourself, or wait would you like to collect a government check also cause your addicted to something?  Be real!




			Posted by: Karen V | January 4, 2013, 7:01 pm 7:01 pm		



How ridiculous! What a waste of time for everyone. I fear the day that Grant gets out too. Obviously he and these other four men don’t know the first thing about taking responsibility for their actions. And 1 Billion! Greedy I must say. Maybe I should sue for 2 billion for the irreparable damage these men caused and how one of them negatively impacted my life. Oh but wait. I can own up to my mistakes! And wasting my time with one of these guys was a huge one! I’m honestly embarrassed for them. How idiotic!




			Posted by: rukiddingme | January 9, 2013, 7:22 pm 7:22 pm		



Alcohol is not addictive.  Some people have a brain chemical reaction that makes them become addicted, but the substance itself is not addictive.




			Posted by: Sheila | January 10, 2013, 12:17 pm 12:17 pm		



Wow Mitt, since the election things have really turned to crap for you.




			Posted by: TC | January 11, 2013, 8:49 am 8:49 am		



They have a point but those who should sue are the RELATIVES of those KILLED
BY DRUNKS.Even the beer ads on regular weekday radio are obnoxious.  Jim Cook raging alcoholic promoting Sam Adams beer.  What a role model.
The obscene beer pushing during sports broadcasts is offensive because the ads combine military  one for all chants but with the goal to drink massive amounts of beer (with a sober bus driver of course)




			Posted by: Irwin | January 16, 2013, 8:30 am 8:30 am		



While I’m tempted to laugh this off as a frivolous joke, it seems to be the future of our society: take no persoanal responsibility for anything.

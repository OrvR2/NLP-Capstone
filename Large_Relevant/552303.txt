Se nota que en el momento del salto se dio cuenta que no llegaba e intentó volver rapido a la moto y terminar de girar pero no llego... le falto velocidad al salto, puede ser por error humano o porque la nieva estaba derretida. Yo era un gran seguidor de los hermanos Moore y saber que uno de ellos ya no esta me duele mucho y no me quiero imaginar como﻿ debe sentirse Colten, se notaba que eran muy unidos. Q.E.P.D.

You should not have gone the way you did, you did not diserve it. You went by doing something you loved. Snowmobiling. Every Moore fans﻿ wishes you could be here getting gold medals longer, but I guess, that's not how this world wanted it. It dosen't seem fair. You will be missed dearly by your fans, family, and brother. Hope there are plenty of snowmobiles in heaven. Caleb, you will not be forgotten as long as a shall live. You will be missed, Rest In Peace.

Agent I too am a EMT. Obviously you have never worked events like this. These guy will not allow such things, unless they are extremely hurt. I have worked Rodeos, motocross, drag racing and dirt track racing as well as being on a first due crew for well over 20 years. They have prodocals to follow. Caleb probably thought he could get﻿ back on the machine and ride the next round and no way was he going out on a backboard. Not saying your wrong but would you rather have fought with him

I am an EMT and this is tragic, the care this man received afterwards was atrocious. X-Games needs new medical emergency care, its the same thing that happened with Jake Brown after falling 40 feet. They should be immobilized and taken in an ambulance with appropriate care to a hospital. Hopefully somebody lets ESPN﻿ or whoever organizes this know so a death may be prevented in the future, RIP Caleb Moore.

why was Caleb moved around and allowed to walk off on his own power after such a severe and serious crash? i was watching this live when it happened and i could NOT believe his crash was taken so lightly.....i instantly﻿ knew it was fatal and i was absolutely shocked when he was up and moving on his own 2 feet just moments later. very sad RIP Caleb condolences to his family and loved ones!

The whole situation is sad, I feel for his brother who obviously looked up to Caleb. Yes the sport is obviously dangerous but Caleb knew that. These people want to flip snow﻿ mobiles so why should we stop them, its not harming anyone else. Sure his death is tragic but in the whole of the X games there has only been 1 fatality, people die skiing or even just walking across roads all the time. Life is fragile but that shouldn't stop people from doing what they love!

Not at all. Let idiots continue doing it. I don't think it should be banned. I actually﻿ think it is Darwinism at work. Carry on.

Ok, but then we should all evaluate our unnecessary risks.We should look both ways before crossing the street to MITIGATE (LESSEN) that risk as much as possible. The more we know, the﻿ better we can lessen the risk involved in our activities. We can wear kevlar armor to prevent injury in motorcycle accidents. We MUST take precautions, not just for ourselves, but for our family and friends who love us. There's nothing wrong in having fun, but we can do it while being safe and aware.

Oh come on, people have died in nearly every sport, Motorsports, football even golfing. Those guys are doing it for fun, and for the adrenaline rush. They know that their life is on the line, if we keep stopping sports because people die from accidents, it'll be a very boring world very fast. We﻿ should honor their deaths. RIP Caleb

this may be the first in X-games and maybe in snowmobile freestyle but what about freestyle motocross there have been deaths there at different events but that has not stopped the sport. the riders know the risks and do it because they want to so let﻿ them compete.

Again, that's your conjecture, not at all the same as fact. The fact of the matter is, he was aware of his surroundings enough so that he could walk off the field, but developed complications that forced him﻿ to seek medical treatment. 450 lbs on your chest wont exactly let you out of the game easy. Let's be realistic here, instead of leading people to falsely assume that mistakes in these kinds of "sports" lead to sunshine and roses.

How is that there are so many heartless people out there. The man died... that is not a joke. It is not funny. Yes this was what he﻿ choose to do but he still had a family. He was someones son, brother, nephew etc.... he was a human being. Have at least SOME respect people.

Yeah I agree, they need more padded snow to land on.
Dude seriously how are you going﻿ to improve safety there? Make them do smaller jumps? No flips allowed?
No different to anything with a motor in it, you know your limits and you know the consequences, everyone accepts them that does this.

They can improve padding in the jump suits, make more crash test proof helmets, and perhaps build﻿ a lighter snow mobile for competition.
One may say a lighter mobile will make the jumps higher, yet still the weight of the machine is more detrimental than the size of the fall on padded snow. Additional to more high flyingness for fun and fans, if one wants to count that, but more importantly it gives the rider more time to decide to bail or jump or make the twists and turns he has to do.

I'm sorry dude, I get where you're coming from, but that's just﻿ stupid.
The vehicles used in these sports are amazing for their power to weight ratio, to make them any lighter would be very hard to still improve on (or even keep) the power they output.
To say ''get rid of the sport" is seriously insulting, how do you expect to have any fun or entertainment when there is no repercussions involved?
To say the least, people that agree with you just want to bubble-wrap the world, is no way to live.

The safety to the riders can't really be improved that much. They could look into maybe doing some new helmets and some padding in the suits,﻿ but that is it. When they go to the X Games they sign many waivers. They know the risks. All in all, this is still a tragedy; and yes, something should be done to attempt to make rider safety better. RIP.

Saw this live. never thought for a second it could've taken his life, didn't see THAT horrible. He avoided having the snowmobile﻿ land on him. Just looked like at worst it be a neck injury. My entire life of watching sports and this will be the first time I've ever watched someone die live. Its horrendous

I ride snowmobiles. I saw this clip this weekend, and my buds and I happened to be doing a 4 day trip in Grand Lake Colorado. This was a tough thing to watch. I didn't even know how much it effected me until after the trip. I had a hard time doing anything outside of my comfort range after﻿ I saw this. Caleb, that run was nuts, and I will never have the courage you do. RIP my friend.

Honestly, no one will even care about this in 2 weeks. Stop pretending as if he was your own family member. I live in CO and no one cares because he got too greedy and too arrogant. Call me a troll, but T for troll﻿ stands for truth losers!

lol you sound dumb ass fuck. First off, im pretty sure they know the risk of doin this shit. But they clearly do it for our entertainment, i bet more than half of these people would still do this even if they don't even﻿ get a fucking dime out of it. Its just like football, people died playing it, they knew the risk, but they took the chance because it was something the loved and grew up doing. Shit, maybe you deserve to die cause all i see is you bitching on the internet

That's﻿ what I was thinkin. Sad story though, for real, so sad. This kind of fluke that looks like he didn't even get hit hard, almost reminds me of how innocent Dale Sr's wreck looked.
Looked like he should have got up. The worst part is he had to suffer, a whole week. Or, with good enough meds, hopefully he had time to pray and see his family.

It was primarily the force of inertia, which killed him. The forces of gravity and inertia sent him to the ground, face first. He would have almost certainly survived that impact.﻿ But, the forces of inertia and gravity sent the snowmobile into the back of his head. He wasn't fighting the force of gravity at that point. He was moving with gravity, as he slid down the hill. Gravity and inertia were actually fighting him, when he was struck in the back of the head. Therefore, you're an idiot!

        Do not stand at my grave and weep, I am not there; I do not sleep. I am a thousand winds that blow, I am the diamond glints on snow, I am the sun on ripened grain, I am the gentle autumn rain. When you awaken in the morning’s hush I am﻿ the swift uplifting rush Of quiet birds in circling flight. I am the soft starlight at night. Do not stand at my grave and cry, I am not there; I did not die. RIP Caleb

You're so terribly angry at yourself for being a lazy sack who has never done anything worthwhile with your own life huh? Does﻿ it burn you that others are extremely successful at what they do? How do you think they get that way? They DO IT. Every single person who competes in any sport has come up short, overshot, miscalculated etc.. this is one of those times in this young man's successful career. It was an accident that killed him, not arrogance. Your ignorance is despicable. Go get a life.

Wow, deserved to die? Too far.
So, he's arrogant because he's competing in a sport where he's one of the worlds best, because he probably loves the sport and would risk his life for it? Yeah he makes money and gets﻿ famous for it, because as said before, he's one of the WORLDS best.
You're probably some stuck up football fagboy who thinks football is real skill and not dangerous. But for them it's okay to do it, because it's not as "dangerous". But they aren't arrogant and selfish, right?

Well jackass, there isn't a "part where he dies" That came a week after this accident apparently "﻿ he was reported to have suffered a brain complication after heart surgery". Go suck on that you sick prick. Go play your video games, instead of trolling stories about athlete's who give their all to the lifestyle they love. Piece of garbage.

Only inhumane? or just sick?
No one deserves to die, he did what﻿ he loved, he performed in a dangerous sport and unfortunatly died from it.

Really really sad. Too young to die with so much life in him. It's crazy that he got up and walked yet still didn't make it. I'm so very sorry to the family, friends, loved ones, and all his fans. I don't think the sport should be radically changed - there's always lots of risks taken for those with adventuresome spirits. I don't believe this is how he wanted to die - but he had a great life even if only 25 yrs - some live a whole lifetime never feeling that joy - and high as﻿ he did. RIP.

The riders know, probably better than anyone, that they aren't riding toys. They know the risks they're taking every time they suit up, and take precautions beforehand.
That being said, it doesn't make what happened any less tragic nor should people who didn't understand his passion, rally to radically change the sport in the name of﻿ "safety".

No, he actually did die from head injuries. After his heart surgery went well, he suffered a brain complication over﻿ the weekend, and that's what killed him.

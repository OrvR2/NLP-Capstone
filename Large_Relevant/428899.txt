TV news anchors resign on air (VIDEO)By Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! NewsSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Wed, Nov 21, 2012Tweet0

A pair of local TV news anchors had a surprise for viewers at the end of their 6 p.m. newscast on Tuesday: They're quitting.
Cindy Michaels and Tony Consiglio, anchors for ABC's WVII affiliate in Bangor, Maine, announced their joint resignations, citing a dispute with management over journalistic practices.
"And finally tonight, this will be Tony and my final show together right here on ABC 7," Michaels told viewers. "The last six years have been an interesting and enjoyable time for us as we have been the longest-running news team in Bangor."
"On behalf of Cindy and me, we have loved every moment bringing the news to you," Consiglio said. "Some recent developments have come to our attention, though, and departing together is the best alternative."
The duo did not elaborate for viewers, but they did for the local newspaper.
"There was a constant disrespecting and belittling of staff," Michaels told the Bangor Daily News. "We both felt there was a lack of knowledge from ownership and upper management in running a newsroom to the extent that I was not allowed to structure and direct them professionally. I couldn't do everything I wanted to as a news director. There was a regular undoing of decisions."

Obama praises Netanyahu on Gaza cease-fireBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Wed, Nov 21, 2012Tweet0

(Official Egyptian Presidency photo via REUTERS)President Barack Obama praised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday for agreeing to an Egypt-crafted cease-fire with Palestinian militants in Gaza. Obama, speaking to Netanyahu by telephone, also underlined America's unwavering support for Israel's security and said he hoped to "intensify" U.S. assistance.
"The president commended the prime minister for agreeing to the Egyptian cease-fire proposal—which the president recommended the prime minister do—while reiterating that Israel maintains the right to defend itself," the White House said in a summary of the conversation.
Obama "expressed his appreciation for the prime minister's efforts to work with the new Egyptian government to achieve a sustainable cease-fire and a more durable solution to this problem," the White House said. Netanyahu initiated the call, according to an Obama aide.
The president's press office released the statement to reporters moments into a joint press conference in Cairo where Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr announced the cease-fire.

Hero dog saves baby from kidnapping, family saysBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! NewsSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! News | The Sideshow – Wed, Nov 21, 2012Tweet0
(WISH-TV)
A kidnapping attempt was thwarted in Indianapolis on Tuesday when a family's dog stopped an armed would-be kidnapper from leaving the family's home.
Police say a man and a woman broke into the home of Nayeli Garzon-Jimenez through the back door while her husband was at work. Garzon-Jimenez was on the phone with her husband, Adolfo Angeles-Morales, at the time of the break-in.
"She started screaming and crying, and said, 'Someone just stuck their hand in the door,'" Angeles-Morales told WISH-TV. "The guy said, 'Give me the money or we take the baby.'"
"The man said, 'Money, money,'" Garzon-Jimenez said. "I said, 'I don't have any.'"
The woman then grabbed her 3-month-old girl and attempted to flee through the back door.
"But there was something else waiting for her at the back door," WISH-TV reported.
"One of the doggies," a pit bull mix, "didn't let her go through the back door," Angeles-Morales explained.
The woman turned around, "threw the baby back" at Garzon-Jimenez and the perpetrators fled the scene.
The mother, who was hit in the head with a gun during the melee, was treated for cuts and bruises at a local hospital, and was released. The baby was unharmed.

New TSA guidelines may mislead travelers, snow globe expert warnsBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! NewsSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Wed, Nov 21, 2012Tweet0

The Transportation Security Administration earlier this month released updated guidelines for the millions of travelers expected to fly this holiday season. Included among the guidelines: Snow globes "that appear to contain less than 3.4 ounces" of liquid are now permitted in carry-on luggage.
But according to Reid Grossnickle, a Denver snow globe maker and self-proclaimed "worldwide snow globe expert," nearly all snow globes and domes made in the United States contain more liquid than current TSA guidelines allow and, in theory, would not make it through airport security.
The new guidelines governing the globes, Grossnickle says, are misleading.
A 4-inch-diameter glass globe—the most common snow globe sold in the United States—contains about 16 ounces of liquid, which is more than four times the amount allowed by the TSA.
"A 1.75-inch-diameter globe holds just under 2 ounces," Grossnickle wrote in an email to Yahoo News. "That size, which is typically used ONLY by snow globes typically made in China and Hong Kong as holiday tree decorations, is the only size that would fall under current TSA-allowed guidelines."

Officer shot 12 times shares story of Sikh temple shootingBy Claudine ZapClaudine ZapPostsEmailBy Claudine Zap | The Lookout – Wed, Nov 21, 2012Tweet0

This Thanksgiving, Police Officer Brian Murphy has much to be thankful for. Recovering after being shot 12 times, he was the first responder to the scene of the Sikh temple shooting in Wisconsin on Aug. 5 in which six worshippers died.
In an interview with WISN 12 News, the officer described how he got through the day. The first to arrive on the scene, Murphy and the shooter exchanged gun fire. Murphy was shot in the face, damaging his vocal chords. He moved  over and down, but the shooter hit the officer several more times. Murphy took cover under a vehicle.
"It got quiet. It got very warm," he said. "Your eyes start getting a little bit heavy, and I thought, 'I'm not going out like this. I refuse to go out on a parking lot, not happening.'
"The shooter came around again, and he fired a bunch more times" Murphy continued. "At one point—it was after he hit me in the back of the head—I just thought, is that not enough? Did you not shoot me enough times?"
The shooter fired at Murphy 15

Clinton, White House denounce Tel Aviv bus bombingBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Wed, Nov 21, 2012Tweet0

(Baz Ratner/Pool via AP)Secretary of State Hillary Clinton denounced a bomb attack on a bus in Tel Aviv that wounded at least 10 people even as she worked to help cobble together a truce between Israel and the Palestinians' Islamist Hamas movement that rules Gaza.
"The United States strongly condemns this terrorist attack, and our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and the people of Israel," said Clinton, who has been meeting with leaders of Israel and Egypt as well as Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Abbas' government runs the West Bank.
"As I arrive in Cairo, I am closely monitoring reports from Tel Aviv, and we will stay in close contact with Prime Minister Netanyahu's team. The United States stands ready to provide any assistance that Israel requires," Clinton said in a written statement.
Hamas has welcomed the attack, even as the White House joined in the denunciations.

Iowa’s governor advocates eliminating straw pollBy Rachel Rose Hartman, Yahoo! NewsPolitical ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Rachel Rose Hartman, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Wed, Nov 21, 2012Tweet0

Add Iowa's own Gov. Terry Branstad to the list of individuals who don't value the Ames straw poll.
"The straw poll has outlived its usefulness," the Republican told the Wall Street Journal. "It has been a great fundraiser for the party, but I think its days are over."
Since 1979, the Republican Party has conducted a presidential straw poll in Ames the August before the Iowa caucuses and other early nominating contests.
Last summer, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann took first place, narrowly beating Texas Rep. Ron Paul. But neither was the electorate's favorite. Bachmann exited the race Jan. 4 after a sixth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses. Paul failed to win a single caucus or primary. The party's eventual nominee, Mitt Romney, chose not to participate.
"The straw poll is a disservice to Iowa Republicans in that it discourages top-tier candidates from attending, and therein threatens their participation in the caucuses, a la John McCain and Rudy Giuliani," Branstad spokesman Tim Albrecht told the Des Moines Register. "Or, a candidate still finds success in the caucus despite not participating or finishes sixth in the caucuses despite winning the straw poll."

Best Black Friday DealsBy Becky WorleyPostsBy Becky Worley | Upgrade Your Life – Wed, Nov 21, 2012Tweet0

Sure it's time for turkey and stuffing, but it's also time for some of the craziest sales of the year. So where can you find the best deals? And how do you separate the items you should buy on Black Friday from the 'filler deals', the products stores promote as marked down, when in reality they'll get much cheaper as the holidays approach?

For Thanksgiving, a Healthier Way to Fry FoodsBy Bill Weir, C. Michael Kim & David Miller | This Could Be Big – Wed, Nov 21, 2012Tweet0

Turkey day is almost here — that magical time in America when the grocery stores and airports overflow with excitement and anxiety — only to conclude with hours on the couch, napping and watching football.
But before the hibernation, even before the pumpkin pie, Thanksgiving is all about turkey. There are endless ways to cook a turkey: most people roast theirs for hours in the oven, some people butterfly it and put it on the grill, and this year Jacque Pepin recommended a steamed turkey, but at This Could Be Big we fry our bird.
The speed, flavor and fresh air - even the calculated risk - make frying a turkey the tastiest way to enjoy the holiday. Sure, deep fried turkey isn't the healthiest option, but it's only once a year.
But what if there was a way to enjoy all the crunch and taste of fried food without the canola oil hot tub?
Purdue University food science Professor Kevin Keener has developed a technique to fry food without all the oil. It's done using a machine called a radiant

Dengue, Malaria and Deadly Disease Outbreaks WorldwideBy Christiane Amanpour, Mary-Rose Abraham, David Miller & Mark Monroy | Around the World – Wed, Nov 21, 2012Tweet0

The tiny prick of a mosquito bite. Drinking tainted water. A sneeze by an infected person. The simplest acts can lead to the deadliest of diseases. And in great numbers, they become epidemics that can sicken or kill millions of people around the world every year. Illnesses such as diarrheal diseases, HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are among the leading causes of death worldwide.
One of the greatest public health concerns right now is an epidemic of dengue fever. It's a mosquito-borne illness, with effects ranging from flu-like symptoms to, in the most extreme cases, death. With no vaccine available yet, poor surveillance and containment means the disease continues to spread. And it's even reached the United States. In Puerto Rico, which has frequent outbreaks, dengue has sickened nearly 5,000 people this year. Since September, public health officials have tracked four locally acquired cases of the disease in Florida.
Dengue is now found in fully half the countries of the world.

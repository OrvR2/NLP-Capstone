Stoptober urges smokers to 'mass quit' 
 


Smoking is the biggest cause of premature death in England

Smokers urged to quit for a month



Smokers are being asked to give up smoking for 28 days from 1 October in the first mass quit attempt.
Stoptober, backed by Cancer Research UK and the British Heart Foundation, hopes a united effort will help many of England's eight million smokers to quit successfully.
Research shows people who stop smoking for 28 days are five times more likely to stay smoke-free.
It also shows mass movements and mass media campaigns can have a big impact.
Public health experts say campaigns that include a combination of hard-hitting "why to quit" and supportive "how to quit" messages work best.
Giving up smoking can be difficult. People are much more likely to quit successfully if they get support than if they try to do it alone and go cold-turkey.

Continue reading the main story Quitting tips



 Be clear why you want to quit
 Tell people you are quitting and use their support
 Use stop smoking services
 Have a plan 


 Robert West, director of tobacco studies at University College London, told the BBC there was good reason to set up a mass movement to help smokers quit because people are "social animals" influenced by each other.
Smokers who join Stoptober are given free support to help them quit. There is a mobile phone app that can monitor quitters' progress and the offer of daily motivational texts to keep them on track. 
There is also a Stoptober Facebook page where people can exchange ideas and get additional tips and advice. 
According to the Department of Health, smoking is the biggest cause of premature death in England and accounts for over 100,000 deaths in the UK each year.
One in two long-term smokers will die from a smoking-related disease.

They are greed driven, profit obsessed hypocrits. Shame on governments that allow them to peddle their filthy wares in a so called civilised society for the sake of the tax revenues they bring to the treasury.

It was so much easier than the smoking lobby groups led smokers to believe. I used full strength patches for a week, then did the rest on my own. I honestly do not miss smoking at all, and didn't do from the beginning of my cessation. If you really want to quit, you'll do it. I'd love to help smokers quit, food tastes ace as well. Please do it!    Report this comment (Comment number 260) Link to this (Comment number 260)                 rate this     +2      rate this     +2   Comment number 259.  I am an Ape Man  1st October 2012 - 23:02   A novel approach and I hope it works.  I doubt it somehow.  The % of smokers has fallen so we're approaching the point where it's only the hard core left to stop.  The focus should be on stopping people from starting this ludicrous habit.  Stop the flow of new smokers and by natural passage of time the hard core will die out (for smoking or non smoking related reasons).

Danielle  1st October 2012 - 22:54   One of my best friends grew up with her parents smoking around her all the time, however she always refused to smoke. Her parents have stopped but now she has started smoking (in her early 20s), and she admits that it could partly be because she grew up with it around her. I guess you can see how the habit can be "passed down/on". Good luck to everyone who is trying to quit.

Tommi  1st October 2012 - 22:51   Great idea. I once had a 40 a day habit, and I was ready to quit for about 1 year before I managed it. I knew it was bad for me, expensive and disgusting, but I was thoroughly addicted and needed a push. I'm sure that stoptober will be that push for thousands of smokers who have been trying to quit for months or years and keep saying "I'll quit tomorrow". Well done all who try to quit, good luck!

Jaybee  1st October 2012 - 22:47   I quit 5 months ago. The patches help for sure, but above all it's the mindset to want to stop. Support helps too and what better support than 8 million stopping all at the same time. It's a great idea!

Audere_est_facere  1st October 2012 - 22:46   I have been on/off trying to quit the fags, found the nicotine replacement products weren't as helpful as I was hoping they would be. I did the programme through Boots (other chemists are available) but a couple of weeks later I was soon on the smokes. I have gone to my GP and I am now on a Champix programme and not once, in 3 months, have I thought I need to smoke. My advice consult GP 1st.

Tamar  1st October 2012 - 22:26   As people often state the reason they started smoking in the first place was 'peer pressure' it seems sensible to try to give up en masse with your peers.  It's worth a shot anyway.  Best of luck.    Report this comment (Comment number 251) Link to this (Comment number 251)                 rate this     +2      rate this     +2   Comment number 250.  Eisegerwind  1st October 2012 - 22:24   Good luck to everyone stopping.Smokers really do smell and what a wonderful smell they radiate. Since stopping 2 years ago I've adopted a new hobby of sniffing smokers, they smell great, the fresher the better.

See if for what it is. A great big addiction to Nicotine. Man up & go through withdrawal, and be in control of your addiction. You'll never be free of it (once an addict, always an addict), but you can be in control of it and have the choice to never take Nicotine again. Forget "aids", just quit and stay quit.

Ian  1st October 2012 - 22:12   It's a better campaign than the "hell fire and damnation" nonsense than has gone before.  A different approach is to be applauded.  But since we're already sitting on a pensions/geriatric population time-bomb have all the long term implications of tax-free long lived non-smoking been considered?

As it is, I've been diagnosed with COPD which is under control but I would rather not have it.  I gave up and failed loads of times and the one thing I can say is, keep trying - the more you try the more you find out about why you fall off the wagon.  And it really never is too late to stop.

If that was the news headline every morning, 365 days a year, I'm sure smokers might take a bit more notice.

Kris40  1st October 2012 - 22:00   If you want to give up smoking, all you need is the Allen Carr Method. Smoking is easy to give up when you understand that the crutches it gives you are illusions which is how the method helps you break the habit. I bought the DVD 3 years ago and within one hour was a happy non-smoker and haven't smoked since and never will again. Check the rave reviews on Amazon, they speak for themselves.

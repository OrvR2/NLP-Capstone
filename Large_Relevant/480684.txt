CS gas use 'could tackle rioters' - Met police review
 


CS gas use could be used as a "last resort" tactic, the report suggests

Riots: Worst areas 'feel unsafe'
Met training more riot officers
Water cannon is 'not the answer'


Using CS gas to disperse troublemakers during outbreaks of disorder is to be considered by the Metropolitan Police.
A Scotland Yard review into last summer's riots, entitled Four Days in August, says the Met is developing more "assertive tactics" to tackle disorder.
Some people felt police failed to help them or prevent properties being destroyed, the review acknowledges.
The force is already considering buying water cannon, while baton rounds are being made more readily available.
The review says the perceived police failings were largely down to not having enough officers on the ground. However, it acknowledges that more "flexible and dynamic" policing methods are needed.
'Damage confidence'
It said the Met was reviewing tactics that are currently recognised by the Association of Chief Police Officers but "are not currently within its scope of options". 
Among them, it describes the use of CS smoke as a recognised "last resort" tactic to disperse groups during serious disorder.
The gas is normally released from a grenade and is similar to tear gas.
CS smoke was used for the first time in Britain during riots in Toxteth, Liverpool in 1981.
But it is not part of public order policing situations and has "limitations" including the risk to innocent people, the report says.
It could also alter the mood of the crowd and damage community confidence, the review suggests.
Water cannon have been used in Northern Ireland but never in Britain and the review suggests it is "widely recognised as an effective tactic to disperse and distance aggressors".
'Political decision'
It suggests they could have been successfully deployed on occasions including when trouble flared outside the Israeli Embassy in 2008 and 2009, and during the 2010 student protests.
However, at present, the Met relies on an agreement with the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) to have the resource available for use at 24 hours' notice.
The force is in discussions regarding the potential purchase of water cannon vehicles - at a cost of about £1m - to be based regionally in England and Wales and awaits the publication of Association of Chief Police Officers guidelines on the issue next year.
However, Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe has expressed doubts about their effectiveness and said their use must be a political decision.

Avalon  14th March 2012 - 11:10   @361.Ex Tory Voter,   There were two aspects to the riots, one was the death of a ango-african in Tottenham. The roits in the south had nothing to do with that they were opportunistic and stirred up by gangs who saw an opportunity to get a load of free stuff without fear of retribution. There was also a case where people turned up becasue they didnt want to be left out.

Alex  14th March 2012 - 11:09   History has taught us that the more violence used against the people the more violent the people's response. if you use gas against violent demonstrators they will use gas or fire back. you will then want to use rubber bullets and then their response will be bombs and real weapons and the next thing of course will be the use of the armed forces against your own people.

I think instead of water they should use liquid sewage that would soon disperse the rioters and then you could use dogs to find the rioters through smell!!!!

Just send the simpering sympathetic BBC/Guardian  reporters who interviewed the rioters as victims of a greedy society, the same ones who interviewed the Dale Farm and St Pauls protestors. A strong dose of that middleclass paternalism of the media should make even the most lawless rioter violently sick.

JamesStGeorge  14th March 2012 - 11:05   It was interesting on BBC Hard Talk recently the host preambled the Syria situation subject as ethnic and religious diversity and complex divisions, not simply everyone against a dictator. Exactly the same situation deliberately engineered here by immigration. Hence the need to set up the means to escalate, deal with the obvious end game. CS gas, baton rounds, water cannon, live rounds, tanks.

Is the Met so hamstrung by health & safety fears that it has forgotten how to do its job?The globally accepted anti-riot response comprises the following toolkit: helicopter surveillance, command & control; mounted police on horseback; armoured police on foot gear; water cannon; baton rounds; CS gas; tasers.

You may have 8 or 9 people willing to use violence in an otherwise peaceful demonstration and once you use gas you will have 8000 or 9000 people wishing to use violence. There is not one country in this world that can say we are a better country for using CS Gas against our own people.

Piers Morgan Eviscerates Pro-Gun Advocate: ‘You’re An Unbelievably Stupid Man, Aren’t You?’

CNN’s Piers Morgan blasted guest Larry Pratt on his show Tuesday night, him an “idiot” and a “dangerous man.” At one point, Morgan, visibly angry, said to Pratt, “You’re an unbelievably stupid man, aren’t you?”
Morgan, who has long been an advocate for increased gun control in America, slammed Pratt’s logic as “complete and utter nonsense” and accused him of being “facetious.” Pratt claimed gun control laws were the problem because they “keep people from being able to protect themselves.” He also said banning weapons is ineffective:
“That doesn’t work, doesn’t even work in England. You have mass murders there all over Europe. There have been mass murderers.”
Morgan responded that the statement was an “absolutely lie,” citing the vast difference in murder rates between the United States and countries like Britain or Australia. He tore into Pratt, saying:
“I just want you to answer this one question. Post what happened at Sandy Hook, your answer to this problem of repeated use of this weapon with these high-capacity magazines is to continue letting Americans buy them with impunity, and to not concern yourself with these mass shootings, is that right?”
Pratt continued to espouse his view that “laws that prohibit self-defense” are the problem. Piers attempted to wrapped the interview by saying, “I know why sales of these weapons have been soaring in the last few days. It’s down to idiots like you.” Pratt quipped back, “Thank you for your high-level argument, Mr. Morgan. It’s really good.”
Morgan retorted,
“You know what, you wouldn’t understand the meaning of the phrase high-level argument. You are a dangerous man espousing dangerous nonsense. You shame your country.”

If freedom consists of arming teachers and everyone else, then these gun nuts and teabaggers have no concept of freedom.

I believe the gun control advocates do have some valid points. But the
problem is the gun control advocates approach the debate with angry
emotions, therefore they are not capable of a rational debate on the
subject. Their point of view becomes a lecture and then eventually when
their point of view is challenged the demagoguery takes over.

Who eviscearated who? Piers was a typical name calling, over emotional liberal (much like the lib posters here) while the other guy kept his cool and gave the other side of the story that libs dont like to hear. Saw this quote the other day and it explains why liberals hate Fox News and are so arrogant and nasty when talking to someone who has other beliefs than theirs. 
Liberals claim to want to give a hearing to other views, but then are shocked and offended to discover that there are other views.  William F Buckley

I Don’t often agree with you Dave, but in this case Peirs Morgan’s attitude is only helpful at gaining ratings and making certain segments of his viewrship “feel good”. . . but that’s what he’s there for.  Not really about adding anything to the dialogue.  I would also agree that that kind of emotionalism is unhelpful and reminiscent of the patriot act “debate.”  I would add that Hannity, does the same thing for his audience . . .

“You are a dangerous man espousing dangerous nonsense. You shame your country.” 
and now this country.
NO GUN ZONE..
How much of a dolt do you have to be Piers?
Morgan is very Obtuse as Pratt points out.
Umm Piers you “left” your country no? I’m sure they are happy about that but we surely don’t need you here.. Morgan spews sleaze.. so un pro for this lame brit .. no debate.. he just shouts and insults.. people just hate to admit it.. evil exist and you meet evil force with force.
Throwing down your arms does nothing more than lead to simple death.. Americans deserve their right to a fair chance fighting back in every corner of this country.

I would still suggest all those Americans that believe it is the gun.. should make sure they do not have and use the modern technology called 911. we can all agree to disagree.

Blatantly lying on television is not giving the other side or actually I take that back it usually is. The reason Piers gets so angry is pro gun people make false gun statements about Europe particularly England where Morgan is from.
You’d think he’d be better informed on gun homicides in the UK and he is. Lying to someone’s face about their home country is enough to get anybody angry especially about so serious a topic.

Piers Morgan didn’t eviscerate anyone in either video unless you have a completely different definition of the word than the rest of the world.  Morgan’s interview style with anyone not only those he disagrees with is to ask a question, let them answer for 10 seconds and then interupt them so he can talk for 3 minutes.  rinse. repeat.
Pratt: “the violent crime rate is higher in England and Australia than in the United States”
Morgan: “you’re stupid”
EVISCERATION!!!!!!

But yet the overall majority of murders are committed by illegal handguns in cities run by democrats yet no outrage over that. Guess its not politically beneficial to go after that just gun problems where you can yell at conservatives.

If you are trying to up your ratings then use an inquisition technique…
But if you are trying to legislate, they the problem must be identified, potential solutions articulated and researched, an analysis of what that solution will do (the expected result) and then use that to measure its effectiveness.
During the ‘Assault Weapons Ban’ crime rates dropped.
The ban expired, crime rates continue to drop.
Firearms sale are through the roof, crime rates continue to drop.
Causation… coincidence…?
You want to have a discussion then don’t call the other person stupid and expect a rational, respectful response.

The truth hurts….The extreme on the gun control side couldn’t care less about people being killed by guns ( Example: Take a look at Chicago’s murdered by gun statistics) and you will see  gun control advocates are virtually silent. The gun control advocates have exploited a national tragedy to advance their agenda.
Sad, but true.

“YOU ARE STUPID FOR NOT AGREEING! STUPID IDIOT!!” How is this “eviscerating” anyone? Piers just yelled a bunch of insults, repeated all the embarrassingly-discredited liberal memes on gun control, and interrupted the guy multiple times. This passes for “eviscerating” to you? Really?






    http://games-survival.com                            Justplaythegame



“legitimately angry person ”
Those who believe in self defense and outraged these children had none from the responsible adults around them?
“unnecessarily angry person with fully loaded assault weapon using it on children”
I believe we can all agree he had a bit of anger and some mental illness with no real knowledge of the value of life, especially young lives he took..
But you make sure to point out insulting language is a good thing when your “points” become meaningless with lack of any proper defense for young children before or after the fact. Nice press conferences though of first responders and how well they did AFTER the killings took place.
How do GROWN ADULTS in charge of legislation come up with NO GUN ZONES in this day and age? What grown adult believes crazies and criminals give a damn about laws? Seriously rethink and better voting of our officials is truly needed.

When ad hominem attacks is all Piers has to offer, he’s not able to debate his points on their own strength.  So he attempts to change the subject to Larry Pratt and nobody is supposed to notice?

There are the occasional debates where one quickly realizes that one side does not relent at all on an proposition made by the other side—even on conceding basic facts such as “the sun rises in the east.”  It’s just all about being disagreeable…as if that is a laudable rather than juvenile tactic.
Since the idiot is going to be dismissed anyway, let him leave the stage with an accurate assessment of just what a loser he is.

Crime rates down massively in NYC, nothing to do with guns, everything to do proactive policing and going after petty crimes like graffiti, noise and wind shield washers. Thus your comments are moot. There is no need for assault weapons period. Ideally there should be no need for guns for self protection. New York is one of the safest cities, may be safer than some European cities, thus no need to carry a gun, and as the fear factor reduces, more areas become safe, people carry fewer guns because they know other people are less likely to be carrying. Having every one carry a gun for every day life is a recipe for disaster.

you’re making an argument that has never been even brought up or challenged.  OP said gun control advocates come to a debate with angry emotion; i point out that Morgan was the angry emotional one; you come from way out in left field and say that it’s better to use insulting language than to massacre children.  Who is arguing the opposite of that?  So again what in the holy hell are you blathering about?

Wow, you must get into politics… Pal.
You demeanor and style are what is needed to keep this country great.
We have a mental health system and it appears the work was in progress to possibly commit or at least help the young man. But you can’t prevent a person from snapping… as Lanza did with deadly results.
It is now bordering on disgusting that you and people like you will stand atop the bodies of 20 dead children all to foster a point and push an agenda that requires logic, analysis, and rational thought.

We are confronted here with a member of the gun-loving savages or some pathetic advocate for them.  They represent a special class of incorrigible and extremely dense individual.  There is truly no class like them…despicable, unreasonable, the very kind to say that the two dozen dead 5- and 6-year olds at Sandy Hook—despite the grisly and ghastly image we have of the multiple gunshots to the head—-represent an “acceptable loss” to the gun-loving savages, in what they claim is their response to an assault on a right they do not naturally possess.  “Massarces of kids are the price we pay for freedom,” they claim.

It wasn’t that long ago English Policemen didn’t carry a firearm at all. That’s when gun crime was virtually non-existent. Now the police are armed to teeth everywhere – gun crime increases. Gun crimes occur in gun free zones, the thing is you see – criminals and crazy people don’t follow the law. Laws do not protect us from criminals, enforcement does and police can’t be everywhere, all the time, so enforcement really is best left up to “us”

Australia, pretty much a country with a strong wild west reputation, substantially banned all semi-autos. So take away the glocks (a mass murder weapon of choice), the AR-15s (another mass murder weapon of choice), and the rest of the semi-autos (they could be restricted to gun range residency and still be available for target practice), and that would make it harder to kill lots of people in a hurry. Of course Australian hunters always laughed at the notion of using semi-autos for hunting, anyway.
The biggest problem with such a law banning semi-autos, besides pushback from the “we need lots of guns so we can defend ourselves from our own government run amuck crowd”, is that semi-autos are actually quite necessary for survival in wilderness areas such as Alaska. There would have to be special exceptions to a semi-auto ban.
Typically I hear the argument that if you take away semi-autos from the general public then only the criminals will be armed with them. I would agree that criminals intending to use a gun in the commission of a crime would probably use a glock if they could secure one, as they do now, since they would want the advantage that perhaps a glock has over an S&W revolver in a fire fight, other than the additional “using a semi-auto in the commission of a crime” charge (with several extra years added) should he get caught. Of course our police would continue to use the more powerful weapons. Professional criminals and gangs would undoubtedly continue using semi-autos even if they are banned. But the average citizen, would find it almost impossible to get one. That would include the CT shooter and/or his mother. And if you look at the shooters in our mass murders, they are almost never professional criminals or gang members. They are just regular people who blow a fuse and who have access to military grade weapons.
Banning semi-autos would have taken the actual guns used in most of the mass murders in recent memory out of the hands of the shooter. Sure, revolvers and single shot weapons would still be allowed, and any potential mass murderers who could pass a background check would still be able to get those, but revolvers and single shot weapons are much less dangerous. We may not be able to prevent murder, but we certainly can lower the body count if we make the more powerful weapons “gun range only”.

These attempts to engage in debates with gun-loving savages like Pratt are exercises in futility.  Nonetheless, Morgan was obligated to give this individual the opportunity to see if he were willing to accept real solutions that please both gun owners and those demanding gun safety, such as the use of ammunition with no-to-low lethality (MLA).  MLA should prove to be the compromise all reasonable individuals accept.

It is often said the gun control laws are ineffective largely because the correlative data is weak in showing they reduce murder-by-firearms rates.  That is debatable.
But the idiot Pratt went further, in saying that the mere existence of gun control laws is a problem, and there is even less evidence that is so than these laws being merely ineffective.  That is a factual inaccuracy given the failure of Pratt to prove his claim.

Gun Crime Soars in England by 35% Where Guns Are Banned
The Government’s latest crime figures were condemned as “truly
terrible” by the Tories today as it emerged that gun crime in England
and Wales soared by 35% last year.
Criminals used handguns in 46% more offenses, Home Office statistics revealed.
Firearms were used in 9,974 recorded crimes in the 12 months to last April, up from 7,362.
It was the fourth consecutive year to see a rise and there were more
than 2,200 more gun crimes last year than the previous peak in 1993.

There is no reasoning with the abjectly stupid.  Morgan was basically asserting that statement of the obvious.

LMAO at Morgan:
http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/334904/violent-britain-charles-c-w-cooke#
When it comes to the question of violent crime, the British are fairly smug. Why? Because, well, there’s less of it in Britain than in America. Bunch of cowboys over there, right?
Wrong. Per the Daily Mail:
Britain’s violent crime record is worse than any other country in the European union, it has been revealed.
Official crime figures show the UK also has a worse rate for all types of violence than the U.S. and even South Africa – widely considered one of the world’s most dangerous countries.
The Tories said Labour had presided over a decade of spiralling violence.
In the decade following the party’s election in 1997, the number of recorded violent attacks soared by 77 per cent to 1.158million – or more than two every minute.
According to the Mail, Britons suffer 1,158,957 violent crimes per year, which works out at 2,034 per 100,000 residents. By contrast the number in notoriously violent South Africa is 1,609 per 100,000.
The U.S., meanwhile, has a rate of 466 crimes per 100,000 residents, which is lower than France’s, at 504; Finland’s, at 738; Sweden’s, at 1123; and Canada’s at 935.

Pratt: “the violent crime rate is higher in England and Australia than in the United States”
Morgan: “you’re stupid”
I agree it wasn’t “evisceration” but when does Mediamire ever have accurate titles here?
Never.
This one was designed to give righties a reason to ignore the idiocy of the gun nut and instead go off on the video in the new context of the title.
That quote you cited proves the guy is an idiot.

-Canada has One Tenth, 0.01, the population of USA.
-Canada has FAR more fire arms per capita than The NRA Of America.
-Canada has Four One THOUSANDTHS, 0.004, the number of handgun deaths!!!

Less people die from gun violence than a SLEW of other things (auto accidents beats guns by almost 3x). SO, for the LIBERAL FOLKS wake me when we get to 100,000 killed MAYBE then your discussions will be actually heard. For the Pro-GUN folks, fix your arguments and YOU MIGHT start to be understood as something other than idiot cowards who like guns and live via feeding-fear.

Premise: firearm regulations do not have a notable effect on the
annual per capita rate of firearm homicides around the world or in the
United States.
Supporting fact 1: Some nations and states with stringent gun control
laws have comparatively higher per capita firearm homicide rates.
Supporting fact 2: Some nations and states with stringent gun control
laws have comparatively lower per capita firearm homicide rates.
Supporting fact 3: Some nations and states with minimal gun control laws
have comparatively higher per capita firearm homicide rates.
Supporting fact 4: Some nations and states with minimal gun control laws
have comparatively lower per capita firearm homicide rates.
Conclusion: Firearm regulations are inconsequential regarding the
annual per capita rate of firearm homicides in the United States and
around the world.
In short, there is no statistical evidence that firearm regulations have any notable effect on the annual per capita rate of firearm homicide for either nations or states.

You have just about nailed why our laws have worked in stopping mass killings (which was their intention), except we can still get rifles, shotguns and semiauto handguns after a 6 week waiting period and background check. Australia had a population of 18 million at the time of the law and a pretty good natural barrier to smugglers, so the buy-back of 20% of Australia’s arsenal (about 700k semi auto rifles and pump action shotguns) was very effective in limiting the amount of rounds a single killer can get off without having to pause. 
Since the laws were introduced we have had zero mass killings, one definite attempted mass killing at Monash Uni. The killer was a sports shooter with multiple legal semiauto hand guns, but when he dropped his first gun after emptying it and killing 2 people and wounding others, as he reached for his second gun, it gave the victims in the room a fighting chance and he was tackled to the ground and held until police arrived. So what would have been a mass murder had the guy not had to lower his weapon, was only a double homicide (horrible still).
 Other than zero mass killings, as a bonus in the 16 years since, despite 22% population growth; murder, suicide and crime have been trending down and are well below pre law levels. Yes we have had a couple of bad individual years were certain crimes spiked (99 for homicide due to a series of mafia assassinations and 06 for sexual assaults), but over all its trending down. While balancing with an individual’s right to protect themselves with handguns, bolt and lever action rifles and shotguns (not pump action)
Having said all that, I dont know if it would work in the States because of what seems like there are fairly porous borders and buying back 60million guns would be difficult.
Good luck to you all. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays

One thing I’d like to see happen at the NRA press conference this Friday.
Wayne LaPierre the National Rifle Association, CEO will resign.  He’s the face of the NRA and at a yearly salary of $970,000 he’s been their driving force in the ‘Obama’s coming for your guns campaign’.  Once he’s gone then maybe the saner members at the NRA, will begin to see that they have to now be part of the solution. It’s a whole new ballgame now and as President George W. Bush so famously said after the Virginia Tech massacre.   “It’s impossible to make sense of such violence and suffering. Those whose lives were taken did nothing to deserve their fate. They were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Now they’re gone — and they leave behind grieving families, and grieving classmates, and a grieving nation.”   Now it’s not just young men and women who were slaughtered, it’s our babies, and their teachers, and this has struck fear in the heart of every parent in America.  The NRA, through their CEO LaPierre, has feed the paranoia of the crazies that do these killings, they need to shoulder the blame as well.  
The crazies will have Larry Pratt and his Gun Owners of America to fall back on.

    http://www.facebook.com/people/Gregory-Peterson/1608524690                            Gregory Peterson



From the ADL’s  The Neo-Militia News Archive: January — June 1996
http://www.adl.org/mwd/oldnew1.asp
Larry Pratt Drops From Buchanan Campaign
Abstracted from various sources. 
Larry Pratt, executive director of the radical Gun Owners of
America and a noted supporter of the militia movement, left
presidential hopeful Patrick Buchanan’s campaign on February 15
after being linked with white supremacist groups. His exit was
ostensibly a “leave of absence” and Pratt said he hoped
to return. Patrick Buchanan supported Pratt, one of four
co-chairmen of his campaign, while Bob Dole’s campaign
headquarters said that Buchanan should have fired Pratt. 
Actually, Pratt’s ties with militia and racist groups have
been well known for some time. Pratt is the head of the Gun
Owners of America, a group of about 150,000 radical second
amendment activists who view the NRA as too moderate. Pratt
himself believes the Bible sanctions gun ownership and has been
quoted as saying that “Consider that when Cain killed Abel,
God did not ban…the ownership of whatever it was that Cain used
to kill his brother.” But Pratt has gone far beyond bizarre
biblical analogies in his quest for absolute gun rights. Pratt
emerged as one of the leading advocates of the militia movement
in the early 1990s. He discussed forming militia groups in his
1990 book Armed People Victorious, and in 1992, following
the Ruby Ridge incident, gave a speech advocating the forming of
militia groups. 
That speech has since come back to haunt Larry Pratt, since it
was part of an Estes Park, Colorado, gathering that was
essentially a “Who’s Who” of racists in America.
Organized by Pete Peters, leader in the white supremacist
religious sect Christian Identity, attendees in addition to Pratt
included Richard Butler, head of Aryan Nations, former KKK leader
Louis Beam, and Kirk Lyons, attorney to many racist groups and
founder of CAUSE, an organization that is essentially a legal
defense fund for racists in Canada, Australia, the United States,
South Africa and Europe. This was not Pratt’s only tie with
racists: he has appeared on Pete Peters’ television show; has
addressed a Christian Identity gathering in Branson, Missouri;
and the GOA’s “charitable wing,” the Gun Owners
Foundation, has given money to CAUSE. 
Pratt’s ties with the militia movement are also very tight,
including an association with United States Militia Association
leader Samuel Sherwood. Pratt has also been a regular speaker at
Preparedness Expos, which are travelling trade shows for
survivalists and militia groups. Pratt has a very close
association with Representative Steve Stockman of Texas, one of
the Congressmen most sympathetic to the militia movement. Pratt
has helped Stockman write articles, has personally campaigned for
Stockman, has given him the most funds of any candidate the GOA’s
PAC has provided money for, and has attended closed door
legislative meetings at Stockman’s behest. GOA consultant Mike
Hammond has drafted many of the bills Stockman has introduced,
while Larry Pratt’s daughter is a receptionist for Stockman.
Predictably, after the recent media exposure of Pratt, a
spokesman for Stockman has denied that the Congressmen has had
close ties to Pratt. 
Presumably Pratt will now have more time to promote the
militia movement. He has already published a collection of essays
called Safeguarding Liberty: The Constitution and Citizen
Militias.

That never happened. The German gun control laws were put in place long before Reichstag and long before the Nazis even came to power.
Among other things, the laws were intended to disarm Nazis (people whose political views were exactly what yours are now).  It wasn’t until several years after the Nazis assumed absolute power that they banned Jews from owning guns.
Please try to remember that you are an amazingly stupid person.  You can be trained to believe anything because you don’t have the ability to think for yourself. You simply repeat whatever nonsense your masters feed to you.
I’m not attacking you or calling you names. It’s just very important for you to know that you are as dumb as a rock.  Actually, most rocks are much smarter than you because rocks are usually harmless.  You’re so stupid as to be dangerous.  You need to know this.

NRA has done NOTHING WRONG. NRA is an organization whose members support the 2nd amendment rights which “shall not be infringed”. Which part of that don’t you understand? NRA members don’t use or own guns unlawfully,they don’t do mass murder and are not responsible for those who do. Being angry at inanimate objects and at people who defend your right to own them is just plain silly.

Actually Mr Pratt was trying to make a good point; that per capita (or per 100,000 people), the US has areas that have lower gun-related murders than the UK. Since the UK and US dont have the same population, this kind of comparison is much fairer than the apples and oranges comparison Morgan was trying to make. Yes, the UK only had 35 people killed last year from guns, but they also have a different population than the US. Piers also fails to mention that the UK had lower gun-related murder rates prior to their banning of guns.

It’s quite simple despite your attempt at an engaging contrary arguement…

‘Piers also fails to mention that the UK had lower gun-related murder rates prior to their banning of guns.’
Interesting…

Civilian armament is the best inoculation to outright tyranny.
Utterly obtuse.  No, beyond utterly obtuse.
A small group of shotgun- and handgun-toting right-wing imbeciles, who together have the smarts of the kid at the back of the high school classroom playing on his GameBoy while the teacher lectures, are instantly erased by the modern tyrant sitting in the White House.
The missing element here in fighting a guerilla war to overthrow despotism is the liberal intellectual to teach them about strategy and tactics, which require that they use stealth and guile—not their 2nd Amendment small arms—to attack command centers and ordnance facilities such that they attain an equal footing with the despotic regime.
This crap about small arms in the hands of the citizenry preventing despotism is beyond laughably stupid.
If you don’t already understand this fact, I probably cannot explain it to you.
Indeed.
If 6,000,000 German Jews had possessed rifles, neither of us would know who Adolph Hitler was. Instead the Germans were suckered into giving up the right to arms following the Reichstag fire.
Well, hysterical historical revisionism—also called lying about history—was the next tool in your right-wing idiot box, wasn’t it?

Why can’t Piers just beat his opponent with facts instead of lowering himself to name calling
Morgan already had taken apart his claims.  But whereas most guests might end the debate with “we agree to disagree,” this idiot obstinately persisted in spewing utterly insane BS.  Morgan likely had never seen anything like
it in all his years of experience—not being used to a drooling ideological fanatic of Pratt’s type—and so he vocalized what everyone else was
thinking.
It was a natural reaction on Morgan’s part.  Certainly not outrageous.  Inadvisable?  That’s disputable.






Ian Kable



You’re conveniently looking at only the data that supports your fallacious premise.
Switzerland has ~ 45.7 firearms per 100 people. 420,000 are actual assault rifles, which are capable of selective fire.
Switzerland has 0.7 firearm related homicides per 100,000 people.
There is no objective evidence that firearm regulations do anything but turn otherwise law abiding citizens into criminals with the stroke of a pen.






Ian Kable



“Among other things, the laws were intended to disarm Nazis (people whose
 political views were exactly the same as yours are now).”
Hold on there chief. Your cheese just slid off of your cracker. Gun rights advocacy is not the equivalent of racism, genocide, national socialism, or any attribute of the Nazi party in early 20th century Germany.
“It wasn’t until several years after the Nazis assumed absolute power that they banned Jews from owning guns.”
That’s a question of perception. The Reichstag burned in 1933. The German Weapons Act was signed into law in 1938. I don’t see five years as several. I have boots that are more than 20 years old.
“You would do the same with Muslims.”
No, I wouldn’t. I think paroled felons ought to have access to arms. If they cannot be trusted in society with firearms, they ought to be left in their cages.






Ian Kable



I don’t need to try my response again.
I believe both your premise and Pratt’s to be invalid.
The facts he used to support his premise were cherry-picked, just as is the case with the arguments of all gun control advocates, but that doesn’t mean they were inaccurate.

I don’t need to try my response again
You were attempting to argue a point not even made, not even relevant to the discussion.
I believe both your premise and Pratt’s to be invalid
That’s odd, since I was not asserting a premise here.  I was participating in a discussion about Morgan’s ad hominem and pointing out to you the error of your understanding of what Pratt was doing.  I am sure that you would like to believe my pointing out your error to be invalid—that would be no surprise.
The facts he used to support his premise were cherry-picked, just as is the case with the arguments of all gun control advocates, but that doesn’t mean they were inaccurate.
Neither Morgan nor I were even trying to assert that there is absolute indisputable evidence that gun controls are always perfectly effective in eliminating gun-related crime, which is a standard gun-loving savages like yourself insist upon for finding them acceptable for implementation.  You started that thread out of left field, and completely non-sequitur to anything the gun-loving savage Pratt was asserting.
Of course you should re-think your response.

Maybe it’s because I just don’t understand the mindset of US gun culture, I don’t think I ever will.

There is no real Gun problem in the UK, because hardly any one has guns and no one has guns for “personal protection”, because we do not cling to our “guns and bibles”. So you need to put your 250m Guns some place up your….. where the sun don’t shine. What sane person could possibly tolerate 35m assault rifles?

This gun lobbyist just runs his mouth non-stop with lies without facts. The top ten states where gun violence increased are all red states that relaxed gun laws.

As I said, it will take guile (brains)—not guns—for you to depose a tyrant.  The only thing you will achieve when your brainless group gets together with their Glocks and Bushmasters is that it will be easier for the tyrant’s elite guard to wipe greater numbers out with less ordnance expended.

Again you are falling for idiotic NRA talking points. Yes some Blue cities have some issues (issues that were really created by the Old south) but the fact of the matter is that Gun issues are caused by Red states. The Worst Blue state for Gun Murder rates is Colorado which comes in at number 21.
(DC is bad, but that is not a state, and sadly has no Senatorial representation.
These are the 10 best states for lowest firearm death rates 1) Hawaii 2) Mass 3) Ct 4) NJ 5) NY 6) RI 7) NH 8) Minn 9) Me 10) Iowa. So not too many teabaggers or old south bigotry/ignorance  to screw things up in those states.
So please take your messed up belief system and leave it back in 1791, do that and stop watching Fox, and may be you can rejoin the rest of humanity, to be found living in the 21st century.

Gun crime has doubled in the UK in the past 10 years. Anyone reporting this? Does Piers know this? Did YOU know that?

“As I said, it will take guile (brains)—not guns—for you to depose a tyrant.”
As history and current events in the Mideast demonstrate, it takes brains and guns to depose a tyrant.

If by “eviscerate” you mean, interrupt, talk over, and insult, then yes, he “eviscerated” him.  If you meant that he won the debate by providing facts to back up his assertions and talking points, then – wait, he didnt offer any of those.

Violent crime as a whole is overwhelmingly at the hands of hispanics and blacks in the US.  Not a dog in this fight, just pointing out the facts.

Larry Pratt is a complete idiot. His argument is completely ludicrous! Way to tell This Man that don.t even know what the 2nd amendment means. I wish more journalist would stand up to such nonsense. Maybe there would be far less people that believe such insanity!






Bekim Abazoski



As much as I am not a gun owner, and our second amendment does allow us to posess a gun,  I would say that 99% of gunowners are sane, it is the fact that when a clip on the gun can hold over thirty rounds of ammo would be considered overkill. Is 6 rounds more than enough for protection, or am I just crazy and delusional?

Well…now you are talking my language! Unfortunately in most cases The crazy kids are no longer separated from the normal students. That is the case where I live. Separating the looney kids from the norms is not to be cold but to allow the normal kids to progress in school unrestricted and have the high maintenance loonies get the help that they need. However, usually what is prescribed to these kids is mind altering, unproven Psyche-drugs. I don’t want to get into my conspiracy theories I’ll just say that Teachers should be allowed the choice to pack heat and that Psyche-drugs should be scrutinized on the same level the 2nd amendment is.

Eviscerate?  Pathetic Piers played the fool.  He embarrassed himself and his network.  He should shipped back to the UK by Federal Express ASAP.

Sorry, but Piers Morgan is the only “unbelivably stupid man” in this particular video.
CNN needs to let this neanderthal go.  He’s obviously nothing more than an over-confident, self-absorbed British twit.






Guest



Actually, I think Piers Morgan is still upset that America kicked Britain’s but with “illegal weapons” a couple hundred years ago.
I keep getting this same line from former and current British colonies.  I get it.  They wish Americans didn’t have all the freedoms which our ancestors fought and died for.  They’re jealous because long before that happened, their nation lost its courage and its Guide.
Things don’t go well when nations forget God.  Now America is repeating the same stupid mistakes Britain made centuries ago.

ctually, I think Piers Morgan is still upset that America kicked Britain’s posterior with “illegal weapons” some 236 years ago.
I keep getting this same nonsense from former and current British colonies. Ok, I get it already. Those who side with Britain wish Americans didn’t have all the freedoms which our ancestors fought and died for. They’re jealous because long before the American revolution, their nation lost its courage and its Guide.  They’re resentful because to this date, America remains the only nation who: 1) kicked Britain’s *posterior* in the American revolution, and 2) saved Britain from Nazi rule (and being forced to speak German, might I add) in WWII.
So, here’s something to consider for all of the deep thinkers out there: Things don’t go well for any nation which forgets God.  He raises up nations and destroys them at His will.  When a nation is serving His will and His purposes, He blesses that nation.  When it rejects Him, He allows that nation to be taken down.  America, RIGHT NOW, is repeating the same stupid mistakes Britain made centuries ago.
The only solution is a revival in America — a mass turning to Christ in repentance.  That can only be brought about by the Holy Spirit.  For my praying readers, pray for a revival in America.  Pray that God will continue to use America to bless the nations, and that He will destroy all unbelief throughout America.  After all, pride and unbelief is where all wickedness begins.

Piers Morgan didn’t “eviscerate” anyone.  Morgan showed that he is glaringly ignorant of our gun laws and 2nd Amendment, that he cannot think on his feet and when presented with a logical argument that he cannot intellectually counter, he becomes a child and is reduced to name calling.
BTW, is Morgan’s work visa in order?  Is he in the country legally and does he have the right to work in America?  Since CNN supports open borders, this is a legitimate question.






Anonymous



Not even, genius.  I would guess your intellect is on a par with Piers Morgan, 85 IQ.  Pretty close?






Anonymous



All he did was provide facts, douchebag.  This video is making the rounds and intelligent people are laughing at Piers Morgan’s ineptitude and ignorance.

Liar.  He is an advocate for the 2nd Amendment.  And you are a douchebag.






Billr



He didn’t provide facts. He spewed out talking points non-stop so no  one had time to dispute them, anuswipe. He sounded like a real moron doing  it too. Intelligent people are laughing at the NRA azzhole.

Or why have cars since people kill with them? Much higher rate than with guns BTW….pfft….






Evan Brockwell



I’m with you Zaydin.  Nothing good ever came of compelling people by threat of a gun to behave.  The best thing would be to have no laws and everyone have guns.  Then, the mutually assured destruction would  insure everyone behaves.  No country with a nuclear weapon has ever been invaded and massacres don’t happen at shooting ranges.

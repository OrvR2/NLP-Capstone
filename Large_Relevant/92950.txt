It has to be a false flag as alQaeda is on the US payroll. The US supplies these people with funds and weapons to carryout deeds necessary for the one world government to be ushered in.These are the same people who the US blamed for the death of 3000+ in NY. The cabal must keep the useless eater from the truth therefore reminding us that alQaeda is the enemy is important to them, though many already know the truth.Peace.

Collateral damage for drone attacks don't matter to the cabal,as they were able to snuff out one so called militant. The collateral damage kills more children than any false flag massacre here at home.Lets face it, our government has its hands in every aspect of terrorism. They have a agenda that must be followed and staging anything is not out of their realm.Manufactured fear and false flags drive the fear that allows this rogue nation to continue its evil.Peace.

Understanding symbolism will enlighten the people. The tyranny is currently in our face. The future is now.The agenda is out in the open and yet many still deny the truth.How could this be? So much has been revealed about our impending future and millions don't get it. They live their useless eater lives in a visionary matrix. Superimposed images of serenity are not real.

First of, all the market is inflated. A few million people invest, but the general game is through computers. The super wealthy have computer programs that buy when the criteria is met or sale when that criteria is met. They can manipulate any setting bringing a false high to the market or they can crash the market.So few truly have so much and so many truly have so little.these people have so much money they can change our economic lives with the hit of one key on the computer.Peace.

Americans should be severely pissed off! Not modestly, not moderately, severely! Government is the problem. They've got in the way of freedom which happens to be the very principle of this nation. The direction of this government was to be determined by the people. Always at the hands of the people except that which is inherently protected by the constitution and can never be changed. A republic rather than a democracy.

"Abridged, infringed, shall write no law ", are all self defining words. There can be no other conclusion that the gov and its shills cannot in anyway shape or form change,take,rewrite or declare our rights null and void. They can say anything they like, pass any legislation or EO, but the law is still the same.No agency or person can alter or exonerate any right in the "bill of rights". Sadly, all those who would try, took an oath to uphold, protect and defend the constitution and our rights.

When you are elected to government you must take an oath to preserve and protect the constitution before you can take on your official post. If you took that oath and worked in the exact opposite of that oath and tried to destroy the constitution then you have become a traitor, an enemy of the state, your committing treason, and have become a domestic terrorist.These leaders have no regard for their collective oaths. They are trying to destroy the constitution.What choice do we have?Peace.

The constitution states you can't do anything about any of our rights, and yet, you a foreigner of all people, and congress seem to think you can. Infringement is just that.Any tampering, at all, is infringement. This is not about saving children from a lone gunman, its about taking our rights and any other way we have to protect ourselves.Long story short, they are leading us to a holocaust.Read the major players 'published' writings.This is the endgame and its near.Peace.

Congress for the most part is buying into the notion that they can do anything they desire including, but not limited to, destroying our "bill of rights" inwhich they took an oath swearing to protect and defend. This is no longer the US of A. It is nothing more than a UN nation state.Our rights matter not in a country that was of the people by the people and for the people. Go figure. We, the ones with all the power as the constitution states, have none.Huh?Peace.

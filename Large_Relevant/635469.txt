Gun control doesnt always work out that well, here in Canada we had something know as the "long gun registry" were individuals had to register their long guns. It was a complete waste of money and proved fruitless. infact it was scraped not long ago because it was so useless, and of course we the people were left with the bill.

Why doesnt switzerland have a high gun crime rate, every man from 18 - 50 is required to have an assult rifle and 50 rounds in there house at all times. Im pretty sure it's a SIG 550. So lots of guns doesn't equate to more gun crimes, it's other factors at play.

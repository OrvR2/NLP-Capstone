A rescue worker carries a boy in Little Ferry, N.J., on Tuesday.
Before the storm struck on Monday, the firefighters walked the streets of Broad Channel, Queens, with a bullhorn, blaring a simple message: Get out. Not everyone listened, and by Monday evening, the cries for help—dozens of them—had begun.
Superstorm Sandy brought Jamaica Bay's waters crashing into the Queens island community, sending residents who ignored evacuation orders scrambling into attics. The firefighters—all of them volunteers—jumped into two small boats and began pulling in people—some of whom had swum out of their flooded home's open windows.

By 1:30 a.m., they had rescued about 30 people, said the department's chief, Dan McIntyre. "Some people are very stubborn," Mr. McIntyre said, though he added that he understood the impulse to ride out the storm. "We've lived through a lot here—this was severe."
The hours after Sandy lashed the Greater New York area were characterized by heroic rescues and dramatic escapes, as officials struggled to reach thousands of people who were stranded after deciding to stay in their homes for the storm.
The rescue efforts continued on Tuesday night on Fire Island, where about 120 people remained stranded. The U.S. Coast Guard and other authorities were attempting to reach residents on the eastern portion of the 26-mile-long island by helicopter and find out whether anyone had a medical emergency that had to be addressed immediately.
Sandy destroyed at least a dozen houses on the barrier island, demolished many docks and washed over most of the marinas, preventing boats from landing for rescues. The only road into the island was washed out in multiple places.
"We want to be sure that there aren't people that are injured that we're not aware of at this point," said Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone.
The Fire Island responders were among hundreds of rescue workers, neighbors and even members of the National Guard who boarded boats and trucks to rush into the region's most ravaged areas, summoned by increasingly panicked calls from those who mistakenly stayed behind. 
Authorities said Sandy caused at least 41 deaths across eight states, but "that number would also be much, much larger if it wasn't for the truly historic and courageous activities of our first responders all across the state," said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. "I saw people put themselves in the way of danger that was really inspirational."
Even in relatively affluent places where most residents complied with evacuation orders, there were moments of bravery. 
In Old Saybrook, Conn., a waterfront community on the Long Island Sound, the police and volunteer firefighters made 10 rescue missions in less than two hours Monday night, using Army trucks to forge through floodwaters that had reached about 3 feet. At the same time, two houses caught fire.

Debris floats around a house pushed off its foundation in East Haven, Conn. on Tuesday after the storm.
"We see the flames, but we can't get too close to it" because of the floodwaters, said police chief Michael Spera. The homes eventually burned down.
"People start wading out of their houses saying 'help me, help me.' So we start saving them," Mr. Spera said
No one died in Old Saybrook as a result of Sandy. Some town officials were upset that emergency responders' lives were put in danger.
"When I hear a call coming out that we have to go rescue someone who refused to evacuate, and we are sending volunteer firefighters, that is what makes you nuts," said First Selectman Carl Fortuna.
Mayor Andrew Hardwick of Freeport on Long Island's South Shore, which experienced major flooding, joined other officials in chastising stubborn residents for needlessly endangering lives of rescue workers.
"To hear cries of help through the night is not a good feeling as a public servant," said Mr. Hardwick, who began warning people to leave Sunday. "The residents have made this very hard."
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg praised the rescue workers' efforts.
"Our first responders have been doing a heroic job protecting our city and saving lives—and they are still fighting fires and conducting live-saving search and rescue missions," he said on Tuesday. "We owe them an enormous debt of gratitude."
Many of those who were rescued agreed. They expressed regret, along with a sheepish acknowledgment that they had learned their lesson. Mea culpas also came from those who were now stranded at the top of high-rise buildings or stuck in areas with no power, hot water and dwindling food supplies.
The reasons for staying varied. Some had heeded calls to leave their homes during Irene, the area's last major storm, but felt reports of danger were overblown. Based on that experience, they calculated—wrongly, in many cases—that the potential peril didn't outweigh the  hassle of packing. 
Others said they had nowhere to go, and were unaware of local evacuation centers. Still others said they had survived previous storms and were confident they could again. "Everyone got warned. Everyone wanted to ride it out," said Jim Mangan, a 43-year-old Broad Channel resident who didn't evacuate. "For once the weatherman got it right. It's a tough lesson to learn: No one listens, everyone thinks they're invincible."
Mr. Mangan quickly realized he had made a mistake in not leaving. As the storm struck, he watched in astonishment as a large boat washed up on his deck. Water eventually rose 4 feet inside his home.
"It's a horror," said Mr. Mangan, who has lived in Broad Channel for 10 years. "After last year with Irene everyone left and nothing happened, so no one really thought anything would really happen this year. Next time we're leaving. There's not a chance we would stay."

Insane? You mean like how the Government's theory completely ignores the laws of physics, metallurgy and thermodynamics?
Will you even watchďťż the video that includes hundreds of scientists and architects using science and experiments to disprove the things you believe?
Or will just again be ignorant to what is easy to find out and continue to try to insult me?

don t be daft - those towers werent demo'd - they fell beacuse the planes hit them, andďťż as everyone knows, all planes carry the stuff to make chemtrails with, and that stuff burns HOT - hot enough to melt steel where jet fuel cant.

Weren't demo'd? How then do you explain all 400,000y3 of concrete turning to dust in less than 15sec before it hits the ground?
Chem trails? You mean the white lines in the sky? That is frozen water vapor from air that has blown thru the engines
So the melted steel? NIST denies this but go on. But, it can't be the fuel (as you said) or furniture b/c they areďťż hydrocarbons meaning they burn ~800C in atmospheric pressures
Just watch the video /watch?v=hZEvA8BCoBw

no the trails arent all water vapour - a fraction is, butďťż mostly its vapourised chemical - exact recipe unknown, but includes barium, and stuff that affects human cognition, to make the population controllable - the governments are doing this secretly, as part of a plan. anyway, when the planes crashed, they were fully loaded with the chemtrail chemical in big tanks(usually hidden at the back and front of all commercial airliners, for balance) and the stuff burns at an extremely high temp,

----once ots been ignited by burning jet fuel. that was more than enough to weaken the structure, and once the few floors collapsed, the momentum was far too much to be stopped, followed byďťż pancaking and pressure buildup inside, blowing out windows all around, and concrete turing to dust upon impact with the ground at high speed. so yes, if the govt didnt have all planes loaded with chems, they would still be standing. regards

Honestly the subject was not right for slow mo action. Nothing much different than standard speed camera work. Did not gain anything like seeing true detail within the explosion accept for the explosions at the bottom of the towers before as they explode. Maybe some tighterďťż close ups of the tower head or base would have given more impressive shots. Again a great attempt

@Danny Rocha, You're right! There's something at 2:30 - 2:35. It trails from the leftďťż side of the screen and speeds up towards the sky around 2:35 where the bird is. It is remarkably fast, even though it's in slow-motion.

I didn't. I actually forgot about this about 9 hours and 53 minutes ago. besides whyďťż would i be afraid of some dutch fag who makes fun of the US over the internet. You're nothing but a little cunt. Get over it. Just because the US is better than your country doesn't mean that you have to go hating on it. Though I admit it't not the best nor is it better by much.

Come on, guys. Clearly they detonated these cooling stacks because Jimmy Hoffa was buried under them, and they had to hide the body. And a cool side note, there was no grassy knoll. Kennedy was shot by a guy perched up on one of those cooling towers. Gavin's clearly a member of Al Qaida,ďťż they paid him to film the towers being--ALIENS!!!!!!!!!--blown up. Black helicopters.

First off at what point in my comment did I relate to the First comment? I was saying that what you said doesn't justify any mockery of ANY sort of travesty. Secondly by what you said in this comment I guess its fine to mock someone or something as long as nobody laughs at it! HELL WHY DON'T WE ALL JUMPďťż TO HIS SIDE WHEN SOMEONE CALLS HIM OUT! And what does the second amendment have to do with anything? do you think raiders in Africa get their weapons because it's legal? NO!

I watched the video and I'm not convinced. It's the same kinda tactic that the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth used against John Kerry in the '04 election. While there may not have been any realďťż evidence to support their claims, they were able to form a strong campaign built on an intricate rhetorical platform. This video, and all Truther arguments, are the same way. You have no real evidence, only conspiracy. Sure, it worked against Kerry in '04, but that was a much smaller-scale issue.

looks like WTC7. WTC1 and 2 fell, then WTC7, so if WTC7 falls like this, then you don't question the falling of 1 and 2? Of course the guys in the Bďťż levels were lying when one of them had their skin blown off in the lower B levels before the plane hit.
I mean, I clock into work every day and some of my skin gets blown off all the time in the morning. Completely normal day.

It's a very VERY expensiveďťż and rare camera he uses(The Phantom Flex)which cost over $50,000 and up (depending on what lens you want) and $3,000 daily if renting.The camera is so good,which is why Gavin goes all over the world to shoot clips instead of a film crew buying their own camera.

MAKING SENSE OF NEW REALITIES IN MIDEAST IS GREAT CHALLENGEBy Georgie Anne Geyer | Georgie Anne Geyer – Thu, Sep 13, 2012

WASHINGTON -- One of the great dangers of these last few days -- as American embassy after consulate after legation is brutally attacked in the Middle East -- is simply how easy it is for any wild-eyed fool to throw the entire world into terror.

Any simpering idiot can take a picture of the Prophet Muhammad and make it look like Genghis Khan, Al Capone or a headhunter from the jungle. And this apparently is just exactly what someone in Hollywood did! But the interesting thing is what no one knows who actually is the instigator of these vulgarized "pictures" of a great man that have stoked the flames of simmering Armageddons across the Middle East.

Point No. 1: A 56-year-old California "real estate developer" who identifies himself as an "Israeli Jew" and goes by the name of Sam Bacile has come forward to say he produced, directed and wrote the two-hour film, "Innocence of Muslims," that by all accounts is so aesthetically and morally awful that it makes our worst reality shows look good.

"Bacile" also says that he was supported by a group of "100 Jews" and that the movie, which depicts Muhammad as a philanderer, an approver of pedophilia and a leader of goons, cost $5 million. It was shown on YouTube for some weeks before anybody noticed it.

Here, my Chicago cynicism strongly asserts itself: Whoever these participants are, they now say they had no idea what roles they were playing.

Muhammad was known in the play as "George" (Washington? King? Bush?) and the "opening" of the film was (where else for our times) on YouTube.

Point No. 2: The entire sick debacle appears to have been timed for the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers. If others had as suspicious a mind as mine, they might conclude that some highly self-interested group planned it exactly to bring forth the violence it did. Radicalized young Arabs or angry Third Worlders or far-right Israelis might do this, as might any number of special-interest groups with demonic intentions.

Point No. 3: To the surprise of many Americans, it was discovered during the Libyans' struggle to overthrow Gadhafi that an unusual number of fighters had been followers of Osama bin Laden. Indeed, many of them are still in Libya after the "Arab Spring" two years ago. What better for them than to attack the Americans on the anniversary of 9/11?

But to attack the American consulate in Benghazi instead of the embassy in Tripoli, and to kill the new young ambassador, the immensely talented, Arab-speaking J. Christopher Stevens, was another thing. It must have been carefully planned. These were not spontaneous outbreaks of fighting. To deliberately set a building on fire -- Stevens and his aides died of asphyxiation, it is said -- is a grotesque end to any fight.

Point No. 4: Where and how were the attacks on supposedly "sacred" American diplomatic centers -- at this point, in Libya, Egypt, Yemen, and others yet to come -- planned?

Were they in unison? Were they all al-Qaida, or are there so many radical anti-Americans in the Arab world today that they could stem from any number of groups?

When we went into Afghanistan in 2001, and then into Iraq in 2002, it seemed that most of us believed there was a set number to al-Qaida -- 200, 2,000, 5,000, but a number of trained fighters that we could quote. Today, to the contrary, we read every day about al-Qaida or its mimickers in Indonesia, in Thailand, in Mali and Mauritania, Somalia and Kenya, Nigeria and Yemen.

Take Egypt, the largest and most important country in the Arab world. Today there are 84 million Egyptians, all hanging on to a tiny edge of arable land along the Nile. Egypt has got rid of its "autocratic secular" regime of military presidents and has a supposed reformer as its new president, the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohammed Morsi. But can he do it? Will he?

He was "sorry" about the all-out attack on the American Embassy in Cairo -- but can he control the boys on the street? Fifty percent of them are without jobs -- will he create work for them? And if they go on attacking embassies and other centers of power, will it be because they really believe in something, or just because they are frustrated and have nothing else to do?

Meanwhile, the Marines are coming -- to Tripoli again -- as in the "Tripolitan War" of 1801 to 1805, when the U.S. refused to pay any more tribute to the Barbary States centered there. The fight was glorified in the Marine hymn, "... to the shores of Tripoli."
As in the first conflict, we can deal with this one. We said "No" to the Pasha, who didn't like it at all, and we can do it again. But it will be a long and complicated fight, and we must protect our diplomats and our military men, who are ready to face such new conflicts.

Our president is taking a calm and cautious approach in a very dangerous situation.  Six hours before the Egyptian embassy was attacked they released a statement reiterating the American belief in freedom of religion and condemning the movie that made fun of a Islamic holy figure.  Six hours later while they were under seige and perhaps feared for their lives they heard Mitt Romney condemn their statement as giving in to terrorists,  When his statement was translated for the crowds they were emboldened.  This seems to me to be an act of treason.  A candidate for the American presidency used these attacks to further his political ambitions.  Romney has never condemned this disgusting movie either.  Nor did he talk about the war in Afganistan during his acceptance speech.  He did outline all the wars he wants to start:  Iran, Russia, and Syria.  How much money these will cost or the number of American lives that will be lost it immaterial.  Everyday Americans need to wake up and see that the GOP is only interested in your vote to put them in power.  The rich will continue to get richer, the poor will get poorer and the rest will be sent to a foreign war to die.

The jihad has been continual for hundreds of years. You are Muslim or you are dead. For them, lying to a non believer is a moral act.

Who really gives a "DAMN" about some "STUPID" movie. These people don't need any reason to protest. Let them protest all they want but "KILL" each other not our Diplomats

We see how stupid our government reps. are. Sending money to the S.O#$%$ and they are KILLING our reps. What did Ronald Reagan say to Iran when they were holding our people hostage, if you don't set them free, we will make a parking lot out of Iran that will "GLOW" in the dark. Stop pacificing these idiots, and do what we need to do. These people don't like themselves must less us here in the good old U.S.of A. It's time to give them the ultamium. "STOP THIS STUFF OR FACE THE CONSIQUENSI ES. The next sound you will hear will be "BOOM"

I hate islam and am going to post my daily koran burning to youtube, right after I soak it in bacon grease and draw a cartoon of muhammed sucking off a pig. If you are an intelligent adult you would say wow she hates islam and move on. Then again you are a deranged child you might throw a tantrum demanding my death. I don't care if these people protest 24/7 and burn their cities to the ground. This issue has gotten ridiculous when Americans need to worry about their hurt feelings.

When we send diplomats to a country, we open relations with them for THEIR benefit. In return they promise to keep our diplomats safe. If they don't keep the promise, like Iran, we break off diplomatic relations and anyone who doesn't understand this, like our president, is not fit to serve US.

5daysagoPolice: Brazil nightclub fire kills at least 233A fire broke out early Sunday morning at a night club in Santa Maria, in southern Brazil, killing revelers — many of them students. NBC's Mike Taibbi reports. By Jeff Black, Staff Writer, NBC NewsUpdated at 1:23 a.m. ET: At least 233 people were killed after a band’s fireworks show sparked a rapidly moving fire in a packed nightclub in southern Brazil and fleeing patrons were unable to find their way out, local police said.Follow @NBCNewsWorld
 The bodies removed from the Kiss nightclub in the southern city of Santa Maria were taken to the Municipal Sports Center gymnasium for identification, police said.Major Gerson da Rosa Ferreira, who led rescue efforts at the scene for the military police, told Reuters that the victims died of asphyxiation or from being trampled. Police Maj. Cleberson Braida Bastianello told the Associated Press by telephone that the toll had risen to 233 with the death of a hospitalized victim.

Officials earlier counted 232 bodies that had been brought to the gymnasium in Santa Maria.In addition to the number of deaths, more  than 100 people were injured, police said, and most remain hospitalized. Police officials had reported earlier in the day that 245 people were  killed. The  death toll could still rise, police said later, from the  people who are  injured.Fire brigade colonel Guido Pedroso de Melo told O Globo newspaper that rescuers had difficulty entering the premises because of "a barrier of bodies" at  the entrance to the club.Television footage monitored by Reuters overnight showed people crying outside the club as shirtless firefighters used sledge hammers and axes to knock down an exterior wall to open up an exit. Agencia RBS via APPeople help a man injured in a nightclub fire in Santa Maria city, Brazil, on Sunday.Rodrigo Moura, who the newspaper Diario de Santa Maria identified as a security guard at the club, said it was at its capacity of between 1,000 and 2,000 people and patrons were pushing and shoving to escape, the AP reported. Police estimated the crowd at some 900 revelers.Fire officials said at least one exit was locked and that club bouncers, who at  first thought those fleeing were trying to skip out on bar tabs, initially  blocked patrons from leaving, Reuters reported.The club's management said in a statement it would help authorities with their investigation, Reuters reported.One of the club's owners has surrendered to police for questioning, GloboNews TV reported. "It was really fast. There was a lot of smoke, really dark smoke," survivor Aline Santos Silva, 29, told Globonews TV. "We were only able to get out quickly because we were in a VIP area close to the door." President Dilma Rousseff cut short a visit to Chile and visited families of the victims at the Municipal Sports Center, where relatives were gathering to identify the bodies. She met with relatives of the injured at Hospital de Caridade de Santa Maria.Rousseff declared a national three-day mourning period for victims of the fire. “Sad Sunday!” Tarso Genro, the governor of Rio Grande do Sul state where the club is located, tweeted. “We are taking all of the possible and appropriate actions,” the tweet read, according to a rough translation by NBC News. “I will be in Santa Maria later this morning.”The precise cause of the fire was still under investigation, authorities said. But Luiza Sousa, a civil police official in Santa Maria, told Reuters that the blaze started when someone with the band ignited what was described as a flare, which then set fire to the ceiling. The fire spread "in seconds," Sousa said. The tragedy in Brazil recalled other nightclub disaster. A fire in West Warwick, Rhode Island, in 2003 killed 100 people after pyrotechnics used on stage by the rock band Great White set ablaze foam used for soundproofing on the walls. A Buenos Aires nightclub blaze in 2004 killed nearly 200 people. Reuters noted that Brazil's safety standards and emergency response capabilities are under particular scrutiny as the country prepares to host the 2014 World Cup soccer tournament and the 2016 Summer Olympics. The Brazilian state’s Health secretary, Ciro Simoni, told the news service that emergency medical supplies from all over the state were being sent to the scene. Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Explore related topics: brazil, fire, nightclub, featured

How many times does this tragic scenario need to play out before people get it? Thank God you live in the US where a life, a soul, is paramount in value and respect.#116 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 12:54 PM ESTCitizen USI really wish I could say that I care...In fact I don't.  There is absolutely no emotional ping to pique at my pathos.  I have enough to care about like my family, my job, and my country.  Besides, people die all the gawddamn time.  I'll bethca 50 people died in the time it took to fix all my grammatical errors.
So, good for you Brazil, for being a 2nd rate country.  Nobody in America gives a @!$%#.  #117 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 12:55 PM ESTLe attVocês (norte americanos) são um povo estupido e arrogante, por conta de seu estilo de vida muitas vidas são perdidas nos EUA, desastres, loucos veteranos de guerra doentes mentais que entram em escolas atirando em crianças e professores, aviões derrubam prédios, tudo isso por conta de uma politica capitalista, vivem e morrem de guerra, e dizem que estão salvando o mundo?

This is a terrible tragedy that could have been prevented.  Not meaning to be crass or insensitive, but maybe a little bit perceptive, surely Democrats will push for an international law to ban night-clubs and fireworks.
Do you agree?#122 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 12:59 PM ESTHank-1921206Sure, ban nightclubs and fireworks right after we ban stupid posts.1 vote#122.1 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 1:04 PM ESTcommon sense beingIts sad, but more people probably died in brazil this year  by getting stabbed.

There are many european countreis that have less fire fatatlities per year then the united states, all because of better fire codes. I think that everyone can learn from this tragedy its unfortuanate that it takes a tragedy for everyone to start thinking about it.#127 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 1:07 PM ESTEric-3683869Pure human stupidity, any kind of fire or Pyrotechnics indoors in a crowed space is always a recipe for mass death!

Probably every fire code, building restriction violated.  Add fireworks to the mix.  Tragedy.
I guess we (Americans) are not the only ones to suffer needless deaths.

EVERYONE, including the revelers who attended this concert should have known better.  It's been said over and over again, "he who fails to  learn from history, is condemned  to repeat it."1 vote#134 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 1:17 PM ESTElson SilvaThere is a continuous undergoing degradation of public services in Brazil that sometimes like this tragedy can end up harming many innocent ones. 
My concern is about a cultural awareness regarding public service with broad corruption harming the functioning of Brazilian society. 
Corruption sometimes is beyond grabbing public resources but failing on important services that can fail on public need to protect its normal functioning. 
I am a scientist pursuing a sort of 'scientific breakthrough' in the US but I think it is time to start demanding more seriousness and responsibility from our leaders. 
Those people perishing in this unacceptable tragedy are the top cultural students from an academic city.
This sort of tragedy is just untenable to a country that wants to host the World Cup and Olympic Games.
We need to change our perception for public services that need honesty, seriousness, and responsibility.#135 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 1:19 PM ESTRenee GladwellI don't know who came up with the 180 figure. It was over 240 killed.
`Pyro-techniques should never have been used. Between 1000 and 2000 people in the club. Way too many people. Alot of them died by being trampled to death. Very sad.#136 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 1:22 PM ESTbill-317053The Cocoanut Grove was Boston's premier nightclub during the post-Prohibition 1930s and 1940s. On November 28, 1942, this  club was the scene of the deadliest nightclub fire in US history,  killing 492 people (which was 32 more than the building's authorized  capacity) and injuring hundreds more. It was also the second-worst  single-building fire in American history; only the 1903 Iroquois Theatre fire in Chicago had a higher death toll, of 602.#137 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 1:23 PM EST

hdaleTime to let go of the pyrotechnics and embrace the glitter cannon. much less dangerous...more people live, and the fans get to take part of the show home with them...simple solution to avoid such a sad situation in the future.#138 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 1:25 PM ESTSandy74SmithDeleteddont mess with texsasguess its time to ban night clubs....they kill alot of people1 vote#140 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 1:27 PM ESTEW-803686The issue is that young people the world over think they are somehow immune to death, and that they can somehow dodge any problems.  I was that way as well.
Someone a little wiser needs to ban things like fireworks in a closed arena.
Even in the USA, go to a broadway show, unless things have very recently changed, there are lots of pyrotechnics.  They say they are safer, but its playing the odds, and someday, they will lose. #141 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 1:27 PM ESTJump to discussion page: 1 ...  3 4 5 6 7 ...  14Leave a Comment:Name: Email Address (will be verified, but never shown): You're in Easy Mode.

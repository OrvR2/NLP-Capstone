back in my youth when FM radio was more or less unused except to play what was then called elevator music and classical music shows, some hippies started seeing a path to  to make use of it AM stations never could.AM was to commercial and in recent times become the format for pre-teen girls who wanted to listen to bobby sherman songs.which sponcers considered safe.FM could play an entire album on both sides if it wished too.I was a senior in high school when they did this one.good memories.

yet another version of this song here.It's okay.....but the best version to my ears was on the 1996 reissue cd and also the 1996 reissue import cd of the "Mr Tambourine man" package. a bit slower then this with Mcguinn's guitar more forward in the mix and harmonies much tighter,layerd, and, lush than here.

everyone is entitled to an opinion but I must say some I see here don't seem to know what their talking about.this is a fabulous album that is nearly perfect with the possible exception of "space odyssey" which would have been lovely if not for the synthesizer.It is very much a part of It's time.The harmonies are wonderful and lush.I to love the early sound of the first few albums with the guitars in front of the mix, but I also enjoy this ,and would never limit my enjoyment to one sound.

dean is the only one to ever do justice to this song.I like the video too.It shows the times I grew up in.we christmas shopped on main street before their were malls.the streets and stores covered in outdoor decorations.I enjoy seeing the old television sets in some of the photos,as well as the real trees along with the first silver fake ones. the 57 chevy,lucy and deszi,lone ranger and tonto promoting christmas seals.those were my times as a boy.

adam faith while huge in britian never really caught on stateside even though the the british invasion was in full swing at this time.one of those puzzles you can't really figure out as he was very talented and exciting.I think american kids thought their brit rockers needed long hair to be taken seriously.

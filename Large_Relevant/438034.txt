History is repeating; author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn warns Americans with his non-fiction, written work: "the Gulag Archipelago." Protect the Bill of Rights and the 22nd amendment. Our Constitutional rights are﻿ being﻿ corrupted by extreme, "Closet socialists" who have a "progressive" agenda that tramples upon established procedure and the Bill of Rights. Beware the United Nations, a wolf in sheeps' clothing.

When did Glenn Beck ever say that the country would be better off with Obama than McCain (as Graham was claiming)? In what alternative universe did this happen?﻿ That sounds like the complete opposite of anything and everything I've ever heard Beck say (on the few occasions when I've been able to stomach him, that is).

Carville goes for pesonal attacks, what a shocker!!!! there is so much wrong about Beck and he can´t make two intelligent arguments about it. Still, he got it right when he coined "it´s the economy stupid"... hope he says now: "it is again﻿ the economy stupid" "it is the unemployment stupid" "it is the unpayable debt stupid" "it is the huge deficit stupid"...

What the hell did Carville say? Seemed unable to make a coherent statement except that Beck is nuts. I was ecstatic when Chicago lost Olympics. Obama's whole crew plus Oprah wealthiest woman in world (self-made black American, still Michelle ain't proud of us). News clips of Chicago black communities killing each other on a daily﻿ basis. The smooth used car salesman approach DENIED! Now Carville predicts civil unrest after making fun of Beck's same predictions over 2 years. LOL

What's there to be proud of? You love to talk about how much Oprah has but that's not what this is about. You equate human rights to money and it's BS! How much can money buy when your country is against you? What is money worth when your government makes laws against you. How do you deal with things when your neighbors will steal from you and the government supports them. ﻿ You need to grow up and stop trying to play these games.

I have no idea what u represent LOL. Why be proud of USA? FREEDOM, the right to vote, live, work, speak, etc. Obamas cry racism even after him, Oprah, Clarence Thomas, actors like Denzel on top for decades, so on. 1 Human Right is the right to earn &﻿ keep $. Most of the U.N. members don't believe in rights. As for ur neighbors, try 2nd Amendment, & stop voting for Liberals that push vote-for-welfare agenda & treat criminals like victims. I'm part of 49% that pay income tax, r u?

Obama alluded to the notion that some "teabaggers" have race prob. But he's too slick to cry racism himself, he uses surrogates: the media, MSNBC, CNN, etc; WH press secretaries & staff; even Bill Clinton & all the Dems. By now u must see he's just﻿ as bad as Bush, if not worse. Patriot Act, executive orders, recess appointments, more wars (without Congress ok which Bush got), big bank fraud, crony capitalism, progressive globalist embezzlement, & now Union mobbery & extortion.

I have watched Glenn's show. I have to admit that it is one of the funniest things on T.V. That is if you have an IQ above 20. If you don't then you will tend to find his show﻿ to be factual. The assertions that he makes are so nuts that you would have to be as batshit crazy as he is to believe them. Faux Snooze is the best comedy network on cable T.V.! Sorry Comedy Central but they have you beat by a long shot.

"....you will see that he backs up all his arguments with facts.."?
Facts made up by him and his team which ultimately speaks against the definition of a fact. I am not saying﻿ that everything he says is propaganda, but a good portion of it is and this my friend is having an open mind and seeing what he does. Be realistic and give credit where it's due and recognize the bullshit. If you still think he always has facts, I will give you few of his examples and then you back it up.

every american has red blood. i could say that about beck and serve the same purpose in assuming it means 'true american'...try to articulate. i agree with what should have been your last sentance (using periods instead of endless comas) about carville not being "a true democrat..more a bluedog dem...or more center".
btw, i dont like becks personality much and he is annoying most﻿ of the time in my opinion, but his political analysis' are pretty damn accurate!

Dear Jimbo,
Congratulations on﻿ growing into one of the ugliest-looking crackers I ever did see. Your former boss risked his presidency and the respect for the office because he couldn't control the 6-inches of sausage hanging between his legs, lied about what he'd done, and created the political climate that made GW seem like a good thing. You tell me who's nuts: Beck or Bill (Slick Willie) Clinton?
I wouldn't trust you to tell me what time of day it is...

You are a pleasure. Even though your politics are defective I know that I like you. What if GB suggested we NUKE Iran? Would the WH do what he said?...Maybe we should get FOX off the air because Obama is co-reacting to them (silly).﻿ GB is not who scares the Administration...It is the RAGE that is coming. I am going to march on DC on 8/28 with the TEA PARTY. You should come Hank. You can yell at our Congress too.

I think that Miami is beautiful. You are very lucky to live there. If you do not like your local fruit or Tallahassee govt. move to the place that has the wonderful﻿ local food AND good community govt. that you enjoy and respect. Please vote for the local govt that supports the programs that you wish. If you do not like Freedoms or Conservativism...move to France or Canada! If you want Socialized medicine they have had it in Mexico for decades! You will never NEED Fois Gras! Its a want!

Farmers far away do not care about their individual customers...They will supply you with whatever is most profitable and efficient. They will not care about your likes and dislikes like an individual farmer will. If your local farmer does not meet your needs, he will watch you give your money to someone else who﻿ does. Local governments know your needs intimately and can manage your complaints. Big governments will view constituents as ants, an annoyance. Which govt. do you prefer?

Lovely Hank...you are so much fun...So you watch the "View"? Does Whoopie re-enforce your political ideals? The Overcompensation of Liberal-DEMOCRATIC ideals will﻿ decimate a republic. It will yield unintended consequences that will result in Socialism. It is like driving a car teetering on a cliff...once it goes too far...you just cannot stop it. ...Here is an example Hank, Do you support local organic farmers or corporate farmers in a land far away? and why?

Swedes are so brainwashed to socialism that it is no wonder if you got that response. America is on the way to be enslaved like Europe and you are proud of that? Thank God for Fox and that the truth is still trying to get out. All﻿ the other channels seem to be corrupted like the news in Europe.

James Carville is one evil man. What is up with the left wing wanting to enslave the whole country. USA has to wake up to fight these elitists who want suck the people dry and make themselves rich in the process. Thank God there is Glenn Beck to forward the﻿ truth. As always, no one can fight him with facts, all these commies can do is try to continue their smear campaign as they know that they are wrong.

Left to note that acorn`s response to the poser was adecuate and that they responded like they should have, but got smashed by the repubs. on behalf of false accusations.

 Well, he's just a cocky son of a bitch. He's said things that would suggest that he's racist. He basically tells you about one news story, then goes off on a tangent about how America is falling apart. I have only watched him﻿ a couple of times, and each time he just annoyed me with drama queen antics. If FOX really wants to defend against the critics who say that FOX works for the Republican party, then they should fire this right-wing nut-job.

Beck﻿ is saying things that run counter to the ball game watching, beer guzzling sheeple. They do not want to know whats coming. Carville and the morons are upset cause he is exposing the demoncrats for what they are doing to America.

As another "nut" I would stand proudly in support of Beck at any event. He exhibits far more street savvy and political perspicacity than most of the clowns in the media - whether on the right (e.g., O'Reilly) OR the left (e.g., Maddow), and he's certainly﻿ far more discerning about what's really going on in middle America than any of the morons in Washington.

@atursix, You really think a guy who wrote 6 books in 3 years, has a radio show, and goes on tour really care about what's going on in america, Beck said it himself, " I don't give a damn about the political process, I'm in the entertainment buisness" that's Glenn Beck exact words, you should be insulted by glenn beck, he's uses people ignorance and﻿ fear to make profits.

Actually, it's the Democrat Party with its generational welfare that has failed and left many Americans (black, white, and hispanic) uneducated. So the Democrats can only blame themselves if Beck swoops in a takes advantage of that group in the same way they have. As for Canada being where it's "at" -- you do realize you ended a﻿ sentence with a preposition, don't you? Kind of comical since you started off attacking Americans for being uneducated. Haha

You are absolutely right, I am glad you see it. Everyone knows Canada is still leading the biggest, most dynamic and innovative economy in the world. Year after year, every ranking of higher education gives about 17 of the top 20 spots to Canadian universities. You do realize, Canadian, that in terms of economic output and scientific innovation CALIFORNIA outperforms you, let alone the entire US. We have plenty of idiots, but we also have the best minds. I think﻿ we will be fine.

Well it's all relative, California is also in a fiscal crisis of epic proportions, if the state didn't have such huge economic output they would probably have to declare bankruptcy.As for the Canada vs. USA comparison it's useless. USA has 10x more people than Canada and less natural resources. Unemployment in Canada is at 7%, in the US it's 10%. Canada's debt is 500 billion and our﻿ GDP is 1.5 trillion. USA's debt is 14 trillion and GDP is 14 trillion. The numbers speak for themselves

It makes one wonder if these right wing nut balls who jerk off to Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh even know the philosophies and beliefs behind﻿ socialism.

Oh Yeah, I am very aware of the philosophies behind Socialism. Results oriented government. As usual it is very arrogant to assume that we aren't aware. You assume that we are all brainless Bubba's. Have you actually watched GB? Resorting to immature name calling to intimidate your opposition as usual!﻿ Your precious Junta (pronounced Hunta, group of people who control govt. esp. after a revolution) days are numbered. Carville is just despencing the kool-aid...drink it up Hank.

Maitlan called it right. Back in the 70's they called us the silent majority. Beck has tapped into something that resonates with Americans. Carville was nearly drooling because he was so angry that people aren't buying﻿ his cool-aid anymore.

I did not vote for Bush the first time, nor did I vote for him the second time. And I believe what Beck says in his books is only truth. Perhaps you should stop by your local book store and read a little out of his books and you will see he is not attacking you and your liberal friends, nor is he attacking the republicans. It's not a﻿ party issue. It's an issue of an out of control government that is taking away your rights. Don't take my word for it. Do some actual research for yourself.

Even Lindsey Graham doesn't want to be associated with the drug addict alcoholic Beck. Beck isn't a democrat, he is not﻿ a Republican, he has Libertarian leanings...blah blah blah. Glen Beck doesn't even know who Glen beck is but he sure knows how to bilk people with BS and make money off his gullible followers.

Of course the first amendment applies the Beck and Fox News. But﻿ there is a real danger to democracy and the process of civil discourse when people trust only one source for their news. It opens up the door for manipulation of public opinion and disinformation leading to propaganda. We cannot have a legitimate debate when everyone has their own version of the facts.
No one should rely on any single news source.
If you don't agree, then you can expect to be manipulated.

Ha! What a joke! So it's the evil liberal media that is trying to link Beck/ O'really/ Coulter/ Limbaugh/ etc to the republicans? Is that why Graham is only now, now that Beck insulted his BFF McCain, taking a﻿ swipe at Beck? Where is the chorus of condemnation from all the other republicans for the nutty crap these idiots churn out day in/out? They disagree w/republicans? Have they compared them to Hitler/Stalin lately? Have they organized "grassroots" marches against repub policy? Nice try.

The media is in the tank for the President. There is no denying that. I wish Rush and company did speak for the Republicans, but they don't. You have﻿ no idea what they say or believe in.
Actually, it was Pelosi that started the whole Hilter/Nazi comparisons, but don't like the facts get in the way. Yes, the people don't like the Republicans anymore than the Democrats when comes to spend our tax money like drunken sailors on leave.

She brought it up and pointed out as if it was the norm at the town halls. She was attempting to do what the media is doing here. They are trying to define everyone who opposes the President on principled grounds as an extremist and a Republicans. If you want to know what Rush thinks, ASK him. If you want to know what a Republican thinks ASK him. Democrats﻿ cannot win on the merits of their position so they do what they always do demonized to opposition.

Actually, factually, if you'd just google "approval ratings", you'd notice that most people do, in fact like the Democrats more than the republicans. In point of fact, the republican approval rating is the lowest it's been in 25 years. Why is that, do you﻿ suppose? As for the media being in the tank, why don't you count how many conservatard guests the news show have on, and then compare to the ratio when GW was in office. About the same, even though they lost the last 2 elections. Weird, huh?

How about the fact that most people identify themselves as conservatives? Sure news programs will put on a few "acceptable" conservatives to appear balanced, but come on, can you really dispute that they are﻿ in the tank for President OBama? If President Bush has done have of what this guy is doing, they would have attacked him 24/7. Where are the flagged draped coffins from Afghanistan? Where are the people siding with the Generals against the President? Where are calls for closing Gitmo?

for at least 30 years think tanks﻿ funded by those same corps, have among other things, been convincing people like you that the media has a liberal bias
It promotes the 2 party system by making every debate rep vs dem. its bias is towards corporatism, sensationalism, and neutrality rather than objectivity. but not liberalism or conservatism

you cannot use the word "fact" unless you actually have a fact. the facts seem,﻿ at least to the ENTIRE WORLD, to indicate saddam gave up his weapon programs in 1996, the un weapons inspectors filed a FACTUAL report stating this, inasmuch, the report also stated he kept the illusion of a weapons program to deter IRAN from attacking, remember them, they are the ones Iraq was fighting in the 80's when we (the good ole USA) sold them the chemicals they used against Iran, just another actual fact!

Two﻿ box cars on separate hills came unhitched and rolled down the hills towards each other, when they hit, Glenn Beck fell out of a hobo's ass.
That being said, James Carville is out of his mind, always was.

Then show﻿ me your facts dipshit, funny how you mindless jackasses speak nothing but bullshit opinion and demand facts from everyone else. You are crying to mith what I just called you on dumbass. The less than 30% was to illustrate your stupidity btw as math and science are not your strong subjects, but I had hoped I wouldn't have to explain that to you.....My bad.

Yes, you're right, the pastor's views are his, there is never racism﻿ involved in police cases, and he hates white people and white culture, thats clearly why he wanted to lead a largely white nation.
I love silly conspiracy theories. That's why I watch Fox News

Give me a break, who would spend 20 YEARS listening to a pastor preach that race-hate speech, amongst people who stand and cheer the racist hate he spews, bring their children to be amongst those people and listen to that garbage unless they AGREED WITH IT?
What a stupid comment that next one was. You're saying he would refuse to lead this nation, full of white people, if﻿ he was racist? and don't even get me started on the conspiracy theory crap... you liberals have that market cornered

I could take tidbits of hate speech over long periods of time, attach an agenda﻿ to it, and claim someone believes in it too. Let's face it, Obama isn't a racist. He's surrounded by white people. He works with white people. HE'S THE LEADER OF A LARGELY WHITE COUNTRY, GET REAL.
And no, the right wing holds everything from birthers to death panels to Obama being a closet communist/socialist/fascist to Obama being a racist to Obama being the anti christ. Liberals may have some theories, but my god.

I think﻿ republicans are worried that Beck won't support their candidates in 2010 and that he will influence a great number of voters to do the same. They should be worried... both parties should be worried that the people won't fall in line with their plans. THEY work for US. We're more aware(much of that awareness to due to people like Beck) of what is going on now and that scares the hell out of these corrupt politicians.

our president DOES seem to be a racist...
if I﻿ said "typical black person", what would you think of me? yet the president says "typical white person", spends 20 years in a racist church, assumes "race played a role" when a white police officer arrests his racebaiting friend, appoints czars to powerful positions who believe that white people need to step aside and their jobs need to be replaced by minorities, etc.
The only thing Beck is guilty of is actually saying what most already believe.

But to lay aside if he is racist or not, didn't the black folks deserve it a bit? I mean it was until 1950 or﻿ so that a black man had to step up for a white men in the bus. How would you feel if it was the other way around? I mean it is hard for not having hatred towards the white culture. I would have hated the blacks if they did that to us. So much respect for the blacks for not killing us. And just to be quick, I want no debate about how the white's will kick the black's asses :)

McCain was taking us down a path of more government control. He would have done that more slowly than Obama; but there would have been less objection to it because it would have been more gradual. I voted for McCain; but I agree that McCain would have been worse for our country than Obama. We need to see this for what it is.... government growing and getting more powerful and corrupt. It wouldn't have﻿ been as obvious under McCain.

I'm not a democrat or republican. I'm not﻿ a libertarian or liberal. I am an American who wants the government corruption to stop. We can't address any issue at all without first cleaning up the corruption in our government. That is where I agree with Beck. You won't see Graham or any party faithful republican talking about that and won't see any democratic politician talking about that. They are entrenched in the corruption. Beck is exposing corruption. We need more Becks and less politicians

If FOX "News" is really number one in America, then that speaks volumes and is a﻿ very sad commentary on just how low the quality of journalism and commentary has sunk in that country. Glenn Beck would be laughed off the air anywhere else on earth. And Karl Rove would be on trial for treason.

Graham is a little﻿ Bitch who the Left coopted so long ago he is no longer relevant. Mary Matalin had it right..Beck is not part of the GOP and has found a unique group to appeal to. The best thing about Beck is that he really irritates the stuffing out of the Lefties and his ratings kick CNn and PMSNBC out of existence.

I'm not sure if Dear Leader Obama was born here, what his SAT college transcript, LSAT says because unlike every other President in history he has sealed ALL of these records. If you don't have an OPEN AND TRANSPARENT administration, unlike what you promised during the election, people are going to speculate. It is﻿ an EASY issue to deal with, just do what you promised!!! Oh wait we're talking about Dear Leader.He doesn't do what he promises and you LEFTY sheep eat his garbage without question.

HE is not a NAZI. Nazi's have pride in their nation and don't bow to foreign﻿ kings and apologize to despots. Dear Leader Barack Insane Obama is a Leftist with both Socialist and Communist leanings.
Mmm, mmm, mmm Barack Insane Obama
He is a Leftist thats for sure
2012 will be the cure

Um, Glenn says himself he is﻿ not a supporter of either party. His message is above party lines that cause us to fight back and forth as parties instead of actual debates. All the while our govt corruption runs rampant. And that Carville guy, man, he did not make one logical point against Glenn other then the same old "cry" thing. It is really a shame that people cannot realize glenn's message for what it is. Even though he is a bit dramatic in how he delivers it.

i argument against that is this: if Glenn Beck was really into debate, why invite people on that differ with him? he just has (almost always﻿ conservative) people that agree with him and they just nod along together.

Um, he has had many liberal people on his show. The ACORN executives that support what glenn﻿ is doing, an actual democratic strategist who supports Glenn, there have been people of both parties on there. The problem is, people who are partisan liberal, do not even give the chance the listen, because they are so consumed by their party the y believe he is bad for them. When actually he talks about universal issues, corruption, taxes, liberty, constitution, fore fathers, etc. etc.

Just to show there's no hard feelings though, I'll save you the trouble and call myself a commie fag doodyhead... ooh, that hurt!
BTW, just what does a dick taste like anyway, and how many do you munch a day? (It's a rhetorical question Dumbya, PLEASE don't answer!!!)

Wow, you've now called me a stupid lib cunt and a homophobic libtard... still no evidence of any intellect or wit though. Not to worry, I'm﻿ sure there's a job as a Fox News host just waiting for you. And since it's not my deal engaging in juvenile name calling contests on YouTube or anywhere else, I officially surrender to your linguistic brilliance. You win. That's right dude, for the first time in your life YOU'RE A WINNER, so hop back on your sister and have a celebratory teabag on me!

The Foxtards wished Obama defeat, and rebuked his intentions when he was on his way to Copenhagen, then they celebrated his (not the US's, not Chicago's) defeat when he was on his way home. And these same folks would have us believe THEY have America's best interests at heart, and that we should all be fearful of Obama.
WTF, America? Our enemies are among﻿ us, in plain sight.

Ah.
Were you just as outraged at the Democrats spending the last 6 years﻿ saying the war in Iraq is lost? Saying that our troops are going into homes at night, terrorizing women and children? Saying our troops are not being supplied, when your president doesn't even call his generals, but once in 70 days?
How about thinking before you post next time, voyeur, you baboon's rectum!

The Olympics would have cost American taxpayers BILLIONS. It's no coincidence Obama wanted them in Chicago. He is the most corrupt politician in America. And what does hosting the Olympics at taxpayer expense have to do with loving America? I can't afford to pay for the Olympics, and neither can most taxpayers. Our troops are sitting ducks in﻿ Afghanistan and this president is spending his time jetting around with Oprah trying to raise my taxes. Carville is nuts.

I don't think so.﻿ If you see this from a libertarian or fiscal conservative point of view, it makes a lot of sense that Glenn Beck would oppose it on account of wasteful spending that have occurred in past Olympics. Beck did mention this reason in his show. The last thing America needs right now is much more wasteful spending.

It remains to be seen whether the Olympics bring real & lasting benefits to the host country. A quick google of the words "olympics waste of money" would bring up various arguments from the Left, as well as from the Right. The leftist environmentalists complain that it will damage the environment, while conservatives would point out that the jobs & buildings it create are merely short-term & not permanent. Thus, it appears to be rather rash﻿ to conclude that Beck is wrong on this subject.

Glenn Beck is a propagandist. Look up 'propaganda techniques' on Google or Wikipedia and see how many sound﻿ like Beck: Fear-mongering, race-baiting, appeal to emotion, common man, flag-waving, bandwagon, out-of-context quotes, the half-truth, etc.

Thanks, both of you.﻿ I just hope someone who believes Beck's bullshit will take the time to look it up and realize they're being manipulated. I've been thinking about making a video showcasing these tactics.

Beefmuncher:
Propaganda does not have to come from a government source. Any group that has a message to propagate (same Latin root) can utilize these tried-and-true methods to manipulate the public.
Today's Public Relations industry, usually associated with corporations or politicians, is basically propaganda. Edward Bernays, the father of the modern PR industry, wrote a book titled 'Propaganda' in 1928. At that time the word propaganda did not have such a negative connotation as after WWII.﻿

Yeah, no shit. You don't have to act like you already knew that. Your comment "Beck doesn't work for the gov" insinuates that only gov't can produce propaganda.
I agree with the last part. Special interests and corporations have far too much influence over﻿ our government and society as a whole. This problem is exacerbated by the propaganda spouted by Beck and Fox. And while the majority should rule, keep in mind that they can be manipulated to unwittingly support the tyranny of the minority.

OK, I did a﻿ quick Google search, even though you're completely changing the subject. You're referring to his claim that New Labour's immigration policy was politically motivated? An article I read from The Spectator said those claims were exaggerated.
Neather: "Multiculturalism was not the primary point of the report or the speech. The main goal was to allow in more migrant workers at a point when - hard as it is to imagine now - the booming economy was running up against skills shortages."

That's a terrible point. Remember my first comment? Glenn Beck is manipulating you!
You're completely free to hold whatever ideology you want, that's (supposed to be) one﻿ of the greatest things about our country. But you need to understand that Beck is an opportunistic propagandist. He does not respect you. He spews half-truths and exploits the fears and concerns of the American public.
You may agree with the things he says - I agree with him in some cases - but be skeptical of anything he says.

But even if one don't agree with Carville, one can't deny that Beck is insane. Glen Beck On 9/11 Families: I Hate Them, They Are "Scumbags" Like Katrina Victims." He made those comments! Do a search and you'll see. Does he really loves America? He has a strange way to show it!﻿

What beck really loves about America is that he has the freedom to turn it inside out for profit, and that will be the mark on his soul that he cannot remove.
His﻿ actions are repugnant and shameful and promote conflict.

What defines someone has being more of a "real American" then others? Is there some sort of test you have to take?
Also, wasn't Beck the one who was happy the Olympics aren't coming to America?
Does THAT make him more American?
Boy, if it was Bush hoping for the﻿ olympics in America and someone like Keith Olbermann celebrated the fact that we were denied.....Would that too be American?

Carville is the main cause for the coarsening of public discourse in America, the one who reduces legitimate democratic discourse to one-word slurs such as "hate" or "racism."
He's the one who started the "War Room" in the Clinton White House, Carville and all these leftists expose who THEY themselves are by their despicable tactics and the despicable thoughts they project on others.

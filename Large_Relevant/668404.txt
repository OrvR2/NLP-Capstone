UK military deaths in Afghanistan

How they died


Full list





The UK's military role in Afghanistan since 2001 has brought with it a heavy human toll. Members of the Army, RAF, Royal Marines and special forces have lost their lives in the fight against the Taliban. Here, the BBC News website offers a look at who they were and how they died.
The number of deaths stands at 440 after Kingsman David Shaw, from 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, died on 16 January in hospital in the UK from wounds suffered in combat in the Lashkar Gah district of Helmand province two days earlier.

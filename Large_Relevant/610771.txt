Blog Posts by Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsIs Pac-Man the same as a Picasso? N.Y. museum revives debate over whether video games are artBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Fri, Dec 28, 2012Tweet0

NEW YORK—The hallways of the Museum of Modern Art have always been packed with visitors looking to catch a glimpse of some of the most famous artwork in the world.
Van Gogh’s “Starry Night” is on display here, as are Andy Warhol’s “Campbell’s Soup Cans” and Monet’s “Water Lilies”—three celebrated images that have been replicated in countless prints and on postcards worldwide.
And just steps away, beginning next March, patrons will be able to observe the museum’s latest high-profile acquisitions—ones that they may have even owned. Last month, MoMa announced it would add 14 video games to its collection as part of a new design category that will display in the museum’s Philip Johnson Galleries.
The titles—including “Pac-Man,” “Tetris” and “SimCity 2000”—mark the first of what museum officials say will be a collection of about 40 video games. Other games MoMa is hoping to acquire in coming years: “Super Mario Bros,” “The Legend of Zelda” and “Space Invaders.”
The acquisition revives a long-simmering debate among critics, art aficionados and gamers: Is a video game really in the same category as a Picasso?

Cory Booker won’t challenge Christie, explores Senate run insteadBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Thu, Dec 20, 2012Tweet0

NEW YORK—Cory Booker said Thursday he won’t run against New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the state’s gubernatorial race next year—choosing to “explore” a run for U.S. Senate instead.
The Democratic mayor of Newark, N.J., announced his decision on Twitter, pointing followers to a YouTube video in which he declared he wanted to serve out his current term at City Hall and “finish" the work he started.
"Let there be no doubt, I will complete my full second term as mayor," said Booker, a rising star in his party. "As for my political future, I will explore the possibility of running for the United States Senate in 2014."
He said he would consult with New Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg, who is widely expected to retire after this term. “It would be a privilege, an honor to continue his legacy,” Booker said.
Booker’s decision is a major blow to New Jersey Democrats, who had viewed the mayor as the party’s best chance to defeat Christie. But Christie, who had been viewed as vulnerable in the race, has enjoyed a bump in popularity for his leadership in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, making him a stronger candidate than expected.

Derek Jeter calls mom of slain Sandy Hook Elementary School teacherBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Thu, Dec 20, 2012Tweet0
New York Yankees Derek Jeter (Desiree Navarro/WireImage)Victoria Soto, the 27-year-old Sandy Hook Elementary School teacher who was shot and killed as she tried to protect her class of first-graders last week, was praised as a “superhero” as she was laid to rest on Wednesday.
But it was a phone call from one of Soto's personal heroes that brightened what was an otherwise dreadful day for the slain teacher’s family.
Just hours after Soto’s funeral, her mother, Donna Soto, received a phone call from New York Yankees star Derek Jeter offering his condolences.
“Derek Jeter just called my mom!!!!!” Soto’s sister, Carlee, posted on Twitter. “This meant a lot to my mother and all of us.”

N.Y. Daily News runs online petition calling for assault weapons banBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Thu, Dec 20, 2012Tweet0
(Screen shot of the New York Daily News home page on Dec. 20)
NEW YORK—More than 32,000 people have signed an online petition sponsored by the New York Daily News calling for a ban on assault weapons.
Launched in the wake of last week’s deadly school shootings in Newtown, Conn., the petition urges Congress to “immediately ban all assault weapons and high-capacity magazines” and pass new gun-control measures.
"Thirty-four Americans are killed every day by firearms,” the petition, which also ran in the print edition of the Daily News, reads. “The total killed in just six months is equal to all American combat deaths over the entire length of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.”

In crusade against guns, Bloomberg finds platform beyond City HallBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Wed, Dec 19, 2012Tweet0

NEW YORK—Just days after he publicly scolded President Barack Obama for not being more aggressive in his efforts to curb gun violence, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he was “very encouraged” to see Obama pressing for new gun measures in the wake of last week’s deadly school shooting in Connecticut.
“His announcement is an important step in the right direction,” Bloomberg said in response to Obama announcing that he’s setting up a task force to come up with gun control proposals. “This country needs his leadership if we are going to reduce the daily bloodshed from gun violence that we have seen for far too long.”
But, the mayor added, Obama’s task force needs to “move quickly with its work.”
It was the latest example of the outspoken mayor holding the Obama administration’s feet to the fire on the hot-button issue of gun control—a subject that has been long close to the mayor’s heart.
In the days since last week’s shooting, Bloomberg has arguably become one of the key public faces of the tragedy as he bluntly urged the president and members of Congress to offer more than just “talk” in the aftermath of yet another mass shooting.
His aggressive posture comes as Bloomberg seeks to transition from being the lame duck mayor of the nation's largest city to a potentially more prominent role on the national political stage.
The 70-year-old billionaire media mogul, who is a registered Independent, has already sought to position himself as someone who can influence and shape public policy on the issues he cares about, including gun control, climate change and health care.

Instagram dials back new privacy rules after user revoltBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Tue, Dec 18, 2012Tweet0

NEW YORK—Instagram sought to calm a growing furor among its more than 7 million users by saying it would clarify a new, controversial privacy policy. The policy would have given the popular Facebook-owned service the ability to profit from and control images posted through the popular photo-sharing app.
On Tuesday, the company announced it would reword language from the policy and terms of service that said: “A business or other entity may pay us to display your username,  likeness, photos … and/or any other actions you take … without any  compensation to you.” Announced Monday, the rule had been set to go into effect on Jan. 16—and was interpreted by many users to mean that Instagram would take user photos and sell them.
But Kevin Systrom, an Instagram co-founder, wrote in a post on the company's blog that it was never the company's intention to sell photos but rather to use a customer's information to allow businesses and other users to advertise to them as a way of gaining

Booker, the rising-star Democratic mayor of Newark, N.J., is leaning toward running for U.S. Senate in 2014 instead, sources tell the Wall Street Journal.
Booker's office did not respond to a request for comment from Yahoo News, but the Journal reports the mayor is eyeing the seat currently held by Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg, who, at 88, is widely expected to retire.
Booker, who has repeatedly said he will decide by this month about his political future, could make an announcement on Twitter as soon as this week.

Holiday Gift Guide: What do you give a book lover?By Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Sat, Dec 15, 2012Tweet0
Buying clothes is tricky, and gift cards are a little boring. So maybe you've decided to gift someone in your life a book for Christmas. But guess what: Figuring out what a book lover might like can be difficult, too. So we asked some well-known authors and bibliophiles to tell us what's on their holiday gift list this year:
Pulphead by John Jeremiah SullivanLorin Stein
Editor, The Paris Review "I can't pretend to keep up with new books--I don't even try--but this year a few leapt off my desk and refused to be put down. Gabrielle Bell's graphic memoir "The Voyeuers" got me through a sad rainy Thursday evening as if I'd just made a friend. Karl Ove Knausgaard is the Proust of the Walkman generation; the first volume of his magnum opus, "My Struggle," kept me up late for a week and remains the best novel I read all year. Maureen McLane's "My Poets" was the continuing ed. class I needed in poetry but never expected to love. Everything I know about gospel music I've learned from Anthony Heilbut's compilations and writings;

Man in Mitt Romney mask robbed a Virginia bankBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Fri, Dec 14, 2012Tweet0
(Screen shot via NBC Washington)Mitt Romney was randomly spotted again on Thursday—though this time it wasn't the real Mitt Romney.
In only the second strangest Romney sighting this week, a man wearing a mask depicting the former Republican presidential candidate was caught on camera robbing a Wells Fargo bank in Sterling, Va.
Local officials haven't said how much money the fake Romney had stolen.
Investigators called the robbery unusual because the suspect, dressed in a Florida State sweatshirt and wielding a gun, spent more time than normal inside the bank. The robber held up all five tellers—leaving only the cash at the drive-through window untouched, according to NBC-4 TV in Washington, D.C.
Strangely, it's not the first time this bank branch has been held up by a famous face. As the local NBC affiliate notes, a robber wearing a Hillary Clinton mask held up the same bank two years ago.
As of now, there are no suspects in the robbery. Local police were questioning store clerks at a nearby Party City, where Romney

Crowd 'go wild' at Obama victory rally
 






US Presidential Election 2012


Five challenges facing the president


Exit polls explain Obama win


What Obama must do next


What next for US Republicans?



 The evening had been gradually turning into a party in this rather cold aircraft hangar of a hall. But then one TV station after another flashed their predictions that President Barack Obama had won. 
They danced, they cheered, they quite literally jumped for joy. 
But perhaps the biggest shout of the night came when their opponent appeared on the giant screen and Mitt Romney very graciously conceded victory.
Then they had to wait. 
The gigantic red curtains behind the stage drew apart to show another even bigger screen, and pictures of them, swaying, waving the flag. President Obama walked on - happy, smiling, with his wife, he held the hand of one daughter, the other patted him on the back. Then he spoke.   
He said he would ask Mitt Romney to work with him... and then talked to the America outside the hall. 
The president is challenging his opponents. For also newly re-elected with a fresh mandate are the Republicans in the House of Representatives.  
He is asking them to work with him. 
It will be hard, but for supporters here that is the future - this was a moment of history, a moment of joy and relief. 
He ended amid a stream of red, white and blue confetti, more hugs more embraces.
This was an election campaign that had some extraordinary moments - but it was won by long, hard planning.
In 2008, they built a coalition forged in the white heat of passion. In 2012, they carefully constructed it, patiently persuading supporters to become voters. 
Both candidates said this was a choice of two visions, and America has chosen.  
The key appears to have been a big turnout of Democratic supporters - especially black people and Hispanics. 
The ground game paid off.
There will be many problems ahead in a second term, but for the president's supporters, this is a moment of joy and relief.

Unfortunately, many of the homeless do not seek help.  They resist assistance, refusing to even go to a shelter or once there, refuse to remain there.I don't see recourse other than mandatory confinement.  Our hospitals are much better now after those horrors.    Report this comment (Comment number 385) Link to this (Comment number 385)     Comment number 384.

It was supposed to be a move forward, away from confining mental patients against their will.Unfortunately there was no easy way to guarantee medication/treatment compliance outside the institution.Stricter restrictions against sexual offenders & where they can live has created problems too.Local shelters house quite a few but can only keep them temporarily.

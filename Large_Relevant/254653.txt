Blog Posts by Melissa KnowlesGirl’s Creative Pop-Culture Facebook Cover Photos Boost Her PopularityBy Melissa KnowlesPostsBy Melissa Knowles | Trending Now – Thu, Jan 3, 2013Tweet0
In late 2011, Facebook launched its timeline cover photo display platform. While some people were reluctant to accept the change, there were many who embraced it and came up with creative ways to manipulate their personal pages. Perhaps one of the most well-known collections of pop-culture-themed cover photos belongs to teenager Libby Cooper.
Cooper, who not surprisingly spends a lot of her free time online, likes to edit famous images from movies and art by inserting herself into the scenes. Some of the most-liked photos are of Cooper appearing in "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," joining the British boy band One Direction, holding up baby Simba in "The Lion King," and starring in "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy."
When Cooper posted a sampling of her work on her Tumblr page on Wednesday, it became an instant hit, racking up 55,000 "likes" and reblogs. Commenters speculated that due to the low-resolution and handmade quality of her photos, Cooper may be using Microsoft Paint to

Stray Cat and Blind Dog Form Unlikely FriendshipBy Melissa KnowlesPostsBy Melissa Knowles | Trending Now – Wed, Jan 2, 2013Tweet0
It's the beginning of a new year, and couldn't we all use a heartwarming story to get us off to a solid start? This story is about friendship -- an unlikely one, but a friendship nonetheless.
When 8-year-old Terfel, a Labrador mix, was diagnosed with cataracts, his future seemed bleak. Terfel was likely to spend his remaining years bumping into things or not straying far from his familiar dog bed. But all that changed when his owner, Judy Godfrey-Brown, let a stray cat into the house and named her Pwditat. No one could have predicted what came next.
The cliche "fighting like cats and dogs" suggests that dogs and cats cannot be friends -- in fact, it suggests they'll fight. But that is not at all what happened between Terfel and Pwditat: They were instant buddies. Pwditat even became Terfel's seeing-eye-cat, if ever such a thing existed.
Godfrey-Brown said that Pwditat seemed to instantly understand that Terfel is blind and wanted to help him. Pwditat uses her paws to lead Terfel around

Dramatic Video of Helicopter Rescue Gone AwryBy Melissa KnowlesPostsBy Melissa Knowles | Trending Now – Wed, Jan 2, 2013Tweet0
A swimmer stranded in open water at Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro got more than he bargained for when he was being rescued via helicopter. Of course the last thing the first responders and the person being rescued wanted was for something to go wrong---particularly with the chopper itself. But that's exactly what happened.
After a fire department team used a winch to lift the stranded swimmer out of the ocean, the helicopter suffered what officials called an "unspecified mechanical failure," and the pilot, who feared landing on the crowded beach, avoided it altogether and touched down on the water instead. Remarkably, the rescuers and the swimmer sustained only minor injuries.
Just after the crash-landing on the water, onlookers, who could be heard screaming, rushed into the ocean to help the victims. Then two other rescue choppers arrived to complete the rescue effort. Once the second rescue mission proved successful, onlookers gave the first-responders a well-deserved round of

Rescued Turkey Thinks He’s a DogBy Melissa KnowlesPostsBy Melissa Knowles | Trending Now – Fri, Dec 21, 2012Tweet0
Dogs have a reputation for being man's best friend, but there's a turkey in the United Kingdom who is giving her canine pals a run for their money. Cranberry the turkey was found wandering around a parking lot at HorseWorld, a rescue operation for mistreated horses.
Dawn and Jerry Watkins, who live on-site and work for the rescue operation for horses, adopted Cranberry after they found her and introduced her to their black Labrador retrievers, Teal and Widgeon. Surprisingly, all three animals became fast friends. Cranberry now has her own kennel outside next to her canine friends and has even become the alpha animal of the bunch.
Cranberry has been known to steal food from the dogs from time to time, and it's a move that Teal and Widgeon never do in return. Cranberry likes to go on walks and also tries to bark like a dog.
Watkins said of his new feathered pet, "She loves being stroked. If you stroke her, she will hunker down. It's quite charming." As doglike as Cranberry behaves, she

Couple Gains Viral Notoriety with Commercial Blooper Real OuttakesBy Melissa KnowlesPostsBy Melissa Knowles | Trending Now – Fri, Dec 21, 2012Tweet0
If you've ever had to memorize words and recite them in front of a crowd or a camera crew, you will likely empathize with Sonja and John Palmer. The Palmers are featured in a commercial for Dysart's Restaurant in Bangor, Maine, but it's not the commercial that has people talking, it's the outtakes.
The viral video is full of bloopers as John makes several attempts to describe the restaurant's chicken pot pie as "baked in a buttery, flaky crust." It sounds simple enough, but John just does not seem able to say the words as they are written. Sonja tries to coach him a bit by repeating the words to him. Sonja starts to get a bit annoyed that her husband cannot get it right.
John seems to get a kick out of the whole shoot and laughs awkwardly when he struggles to nail the take. He instructs whoever is holding the cue cards to make sure they keep the cue cards up for him to see.
When Sonja just can't take it anymore, she says, "You should have had me do that." John agrees, "Oh yeah, she

Unbelievable Video of Cows Surviving CrashBy Melissa KnowlesPostsBy Melissa Knowles | Trending Now – Thu, Dec 20, 2012Tweet0
You may not believe your eyes when you watch the video. A dashboard camera in Russia captured an unbelievable accident involving a truck carrying cattle. The truck collides with a vehicle going the opposite direction. The impact forces the truck to suddenly make a hard turn and then flip onto its side.
The compartment containing at least a dozen cows empties onto the road, and they are tossed out violently. Remarkably, the cows, likely stunned by the collision, appear unscathed as they seem to get up one by one and start to walk away.
The video titled, "Truck full of Cows Crashed," is going viral, as it has been viewed more than 490,000 times on YouTube and counting. Many commenters are amazed by the video and the cows survival. Some feel really badly for the cows, with one person writing, "poor cows." Another person took time to come up with a clever pun, calling the video, "utterly amazing."
Not everyone who has seen the video believes that it's real, given how calmly the cattle seem

New Species of Spider Makes Its Own Decoy to Fool PredatorsBy Melissa KnowlesPostsBy Melissa Knowles | Trending Now – Thu, Dec 20, 2012Tweet0
If you have arachnophobia, you may want to prepare yourself, because what you're about to read could totally creep you out. It is one of the coolest examples of self-defense ever seen in nature. It begins with the discovery of a new species of spider found at the Tambopata Research Center in the Amazon. What makes the spider so different is that it creates its own decoy spider to protect itself from predators.
The decoy is made of leaves, dead bug parts, and other scraps the arachnid finds. It places the decoy in its web and moves out of sight. Scientists believe the spider belongs to the genus Cyclosa and is a quarter the size of its decoy. The Cyclosa genus is known to put debris in its web to distract or entice prey and enemies. Researches have never seen a full-on spider-shaped decoy before. So the discovery of this arachnid is especially remarkable.
The arachnid was found by scientist Phil Torres, who wrote about it in the blog "Rainforest Expeditions." Torres says the decoy is

Pintsize Rapper Creates Music Video Tribute to Sandy Hook VictimsBy Melissa KnowlesPostsBy Melissa Knowles | Trending Now – Wed, Dec 19, 2012Tweet0
If you did not know the name Amor "Lilman" Arteaga, you will now. Arteaga is a pintsize 9-year-old rapper from Brooklyn. His first music video, "Pull Ya Pants Up," featured Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, and it went viral over the summer. The video addressed the trend of guys wearing their pants sagging and has amassed more than 107,000 views to date.
Lilman spent the fall working on a new video for his song called "Stop da Violence." The song addresses issues like bullying, gun violence, and domestic violence. As Lilman raps, there's even a crowd of  schoolchildren singing "Put the guns down" throughout the video.
After the horrific shooting that took place December 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, Lilman decided to include a tribute at the end of his video to the 20 students and six teachers who were killed.
Lilman stresses how important it is for young people to be aware of what's happening around them and how effective it can be to have an

‘Golden Eagle Snatches Kid’ video fools the InternetBy Melissa KnowlesPostsBy Melissa Knowles | Trending Now – Wed, Dec 19, 2012Tweet0

One of the newest videos making its way around the Net has turned out to be a hoax. In "Golden Eagle Snatches Kid," the supposed eagle in Montreal, Canada, is first seen soaring in the sky above. It suddenly dives down and appears to grab a toddler, picking him up for a brief moment before dropping him back down.
The encounter seems plausible at first, but it has just been confirmed to be the work of clever computer graphics wizardry. For an entire day until now, YouTube and blog commenters debated whether the video was authentic.
One commenter swore it was the real deal: "That is so real... Eagles do do this sometimes." One viewer took a comical approach to debunk the video, writing, "Kidnapping children is ill-eagle." Other users made a more technological assessment. User Cyatek uploaded his own version of the video, "Golden Eagle Snatches Kid -- Fake," in which he zoomed in and slowed down the video, revealing what he said was some clever CGI. Cyatek points out that the child hangs

Blind Surfer Defies Limitations by Conquering the Banzai PipelineBy Melissa KnowlesPostsBy Melissa Knowles | Trending Now – Tue, Dec 18, 2012Tweet0
Surfing big waves in the ocean is a skill that takes a lot of practice, technique, balance, and talent. In fact, even experienced surfers have the occasional wipeout and sustain injuries in their pursuit of the big waves. The combination of skill and danger makes Brazilian surfer Derek Rabelo's story all the more incredible.
Rabelo lost his eyesight to glaucoma when he was just 1 year old, but that setback has not stopped the 19-year-old from becoming proficient in a wide range of outdoor sports, including swimming and skating. In his own words: "I don't feel different from others. I feel normal, and I don't feel limited at all." He especially loves to surf, following in the footsteps of his father and uncles.
Rabelo began honing his surfing skills two and a half years ago in Rio de Janeiro while attending a local surfing school there. He said that because of his inability to see, he uses other senses like touch and sound to gauge the size and shape of the waves he rides. His mother,

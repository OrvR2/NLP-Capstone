YANGON (Reuters) - Cronies of Myanmar's military junta which kept democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest for nearly two decades have reached a milestone in their quest to rehabilitate their image: they're now donors to Suu Kyi's political party.
              While the Nobel Peace laureate's willingness to accept military-tainted funds for education projects might jar with her international image, her supporters praised the move as politically shrewd and financially necessary.
              Suu Kyi's opposition party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), accepted 211.5 million kyat ($250,000) at a fundraising concert from companies owned by Western-blacklisted businessmen who made fortunes under the military dictatorship that ruled Myanmar for almost half a century.
              The donations have caused barely a stir in Myanmar, a sign of how much Suu Kyi is revered and of how successfully the cronies have repositioned themselves since a reformist government came to power in March 2011. Some see it as a sign of reconciliation after five decades of military misrule.
              AGB Bank, owned by self-proclaimed billionaire Tay Za, once described by the U.S. Treasury as "a notorious regime henchman and arms dealer", donated 40 million kyat ($47,000) to Suu Kyi's party at a December concert.
              The wife of Kyaw Win, a tycoon who owns the conglomerate Shwe Than Lwin and private television station SkyNet, donated a further 41.5 million kyat ($50,000) in an auction for one of two sweaters knitted by Suu Kyi, while SkyNet itself donated 130 million kyat ($151,430).
              "All the money we have raised is for educational purposes, and has nothing to do with the rest of the party," said Myint Myint Sein, who is responsible for the NLD's humanitarian and education policies.
              A top official said the party was "very thankful" for the donations. "I am sure all party members are happy about this," said Naing Naing, who sits on the NLD's Central Executive Committee.
              Tay Za and many other well-connected businessmen remain on Western blacklists despite the suspension last year of most sanctions against the government following a year of dramatic reforms, including amnesty for hundreds of political prisoners.
              Many people loathe and mistrust them for their tacit support of a brutal regime, conspicuous flaunting of wealth and continued domination of many sectors of Myanmar's economy.
              "CHANCE TO MEND THEIR WAYS"
              Opposition leader Suu Kyi, who spent a total of 17 years under house arrest until she was freed in 2010, defended her actions last week, saying it was better to donate money for good purposes rather than waste it.
              "Anybody should be given a chance to mend their ways, no matter how much wrong they have done," she said.
              Her association with what she called "those so-called cronies" seems not to have harmed her reputation, already dented by criticisms that she has not stood up for ethnic victims of state-sponsored violence.
              Some supporters on Facebook, the main forum for popular political discussion in Myanmar, have nicknamed Suu Kyi "Robin Suu", a reference to the English outlaw Robin Hood who stole from the rich to give to the poor.
              "I don't think it is a major scandal," said Mark Farmaner, director of Burma Campaign UK. "We've not seen any evidence yet that receiving donations from cronies is going to have an effect on policy. The NLD don't have many policies to implement yet."
              The donations are vital to a party which lacks a mechanism to raise funds from its million-plus members, most of whom are poor.
              "In politics, funding is essential to survive," said Derek Tonkin, a former British ambassador to Myanmar. "It has to come from local sources. Provided the 'cronies' fund the right projects, why should we complain? The Burmese people certainly won't."
              By accepting donations from Myanmar's richest civilians, Suu Kyi's party is extending a hand to key players in the country's economic recovery, said Trevor Wilson, a former Australian ambassador to Myanmar.
              "The cronies have a tremendous economic stake in the future of the country. It's most important to bring them under the rule of law," he said.
              Both Suu Kyi and her funders are planning for a 2015 general election, in which the NLD faces an unpopular but well-funded rival party established under the former junta.

Military needs to have a role in burmese society to maintain the stability of burma !!! So it is correct that suu kyi takes steps to build bridges with the supporters of the military junta !!! Both sides should learn to work together for the betterment of the burmese society !!!

In the last 20 years the former Military Dictatorship government of Myanmar has been used by China, India, Thailand and other countries/multinationals to strip the country of Myanmar of natural resources without compensating the people of Myanmar.. These resources include:
-TIMBER: Myanmar is now experiencing one of the fastest deforestation rates on earth. (much of the timber has gone to, or is going to China).
-OIL AND NATURAL GAS: With little, or no, compensation to the people of Myanmar and pollution of land water.
-DAMS AND MEGA-DAMS on almost all of Myanmar's rivers (with more to come): The hydro-electricity is sold and shipped out of the country to China, Thailand and India via electrical transmission lines with little of the electricity, or money from the sale of the electricity, going to the people of Myanmar. The dams have flooded out hundreds, if not thousands of square miles of riverside land, forest, farms, villages, destroyed fisheries and ruined rivers. The flooding caused by the enormous dam reservoirs has displaced Myanmar's people at the rate of 100-30,000 per each dam built. (an estimated 150 large dams built in the last 20-30 years). These are some of the largest dams in Southeast Asia. 45 Chinese multinationals have been involved in 63 hydropower projects in Myanmar and are currently involved in 20 more river destroying MEGA-DAM projects. Southeast Asian tribal people are heavily dependent on river fish for protein and have been for tens of
thousands of years.....river fishing is deeply ingrained in their culture/way of life.
-MINERALS: China and other nations/mulinationals are heavily involved in minerals extraction in Myanmar. (do we think that the military dictatorship there, or the Chinese, are worried about mining chemicals/heavy metals pollution into waterways?).
-LABOR THEFT: When resources are exploited in Myanmar the military government there often uses the fleeing people in the resource extraction area as SLAVE LABOR to work on the resource extraction operations/road building. ( these are often uneducated tribal people who are not able to defend themselves. ( YouTube the Rohingya people of Myanmar ).
-AGRIBUSINESS: large scale forest clearing is planned and underway in Myanmar to plant palm oil for biofuels and also cotton, sugar cane and other non-food crops which will likely bring little benefit to the people of Myanmar.
An estimated 1 million refugees have now fled to the nations that surround Myanmar to avoid the government/corporate oppression, arrest and killing that has come with the military government's abuse of power. Many of these refugees are trapped within Myanmar and exist as stateless people with no recourse for justice. (type Myanmar/refugees into your search engine). Many of the young women refugees have been preyed upon by the military/police there and been exploited, abused. Many have likely DIED after being forced into Southeast Asia's sex trade. Type "International Rivers" into your search engine to find out more.

This is all corporate media propaganda. Suu Kyi voice was unheard as Myanmar military persecuted Muslims and Christians with thousands killed and displaced. This ethnic cleansing has been ignored by the media and Obama administration because of goal of decreasing Chinese influence in Asia. Xinhaunews and rtnews give more truthful accounts of the actions of the Myanmar regime.

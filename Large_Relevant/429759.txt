We all see angels around us every day, some demons are even famous as actors & musicians etc. when you realise where you are & how poor you are in the mortal state, you will run to seek the eternal life more diligently. You're not ready to know some of the deeper secrets of what's right before your eyes. Generations come & generations go, but only some live forever! recognise the liars & hear the truth. There are many creatures in human form around us; two tribes: light & dark!

Jesus Saves!

Early Christians forsook marriage & sexual relations upon baptism (married couples even staying together but abstaining from sex). The Nicolaitans (Revelation 2:15) are false teachers that introduce adulterous marriages, sexual sin & lack of fasting in the church.
Paul: 
"Blessed are they who keep their flesh undefiled, for they shall be the temple of God"
"Blessed are they who have wives as though they had them not, for they shall be made angels of God"
The Acts of Paul & Thecla (Apocrypha)

Understand who the principalities that govern all countries are! They are rebel angels & there are allot of them everywhere (you mistake them for people). This has nothing to do with S.Africa, rather the whole world. Antichrist is ready for his glory hour & in each country the same thing is happening with a different guise. The same angelic powers that were in white bodies are now in black bodies (angels can shape shift in any form) in fact that’s what eternal life is: the immortal angelic life!

John 11:25-26
“Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection & the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; & whoever lives & believes in me will never die”
1Corinthians 15:51-53
“We will not all sleep (die), but we will all be changed— in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable & we will be changed. For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable & the mortal with immortality”

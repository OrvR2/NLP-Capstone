4daysagoFrom joy to tragedy: Inside the Brazil nightclub where 233 diedSlideshow: Nightclub fire in BrazilYuri Weber/ Agencia O Dia via ReutersAn interior view of the Kiss nightclub in Santa Maria, Brazil, after it was destroyed by a fire on Jan. 27. Launch slideshowBy Alastair Jamieson, Staff Writer,  NBC NewsShoes, bottles and slices of lime lay scattered around the blackened remains of a dancefloor in Brazil on Monday – signs of how quickly a Saturday night student party turned into one of the world’s worst nightclub fires.End-of-summer celebrations were in full swing at the Kiss club in the university town of Santa Maria when a band’s pyrotechnic display set fire to the sound-proofed ceiling and started a fire that choked dozens to death and saw dozens more trampled in the ensuing panic.The image of the burned, empty building was in stark contrast to the town’s packed gymnasium where relatives of the victims gathered late on Sunday to mourn after the mortuary became overwhelmed with bodies.

One woman fell to her knees in grief at the coffin of a relative, while others waited to identify their loved ones.In total, at least 233 died - 120 men and 113 women - while 92 people are still being treated in hospitals, Reuters reported.About 50 funerals were expected to take place at the municipal cemetery in Santa Maria on Monday, according to Brazilian television news broadcast Zero Hora.The cemetery opened early, at 7:30 a.m. local time (4:30 a.m. ET), and was planning to conduct burials at half-hour intervals, O Globo reported, saying the army had helped dig graves.A Brazilian nightclub owner and two members of a band have been arrested by civil police investigating the blaze, newspaper Diario de Santa Maria reported Monday. A fourth person is also being sought, the newspaper said.It said businessman Elissandro Spohr, also known as ‘Kiko’ – one of the owners of the Kiss nightclub in the city of Santa Maria – was detained “on a temporary basis.”Marcelo Arigony, a police inspector, said the arrests were "provisional" and that there was not yet a criminal accusation. He declined to confirm the identities of those arrested, saying the investigation "is still quite precarious."Sphor's lawyer, Jader Marques, told the Diario de Santa Maria that his client was present in the club with his pregnant wife at the moment that a spark from the pyrotechnic flare or fuse handled by the band lit the soundproofing on the ceiling.One of the worst nightclub fires in history has claimed a terrible toll in the southern Brazil city of Santa Maria, with at least 233 dead by the most recent count. Authorities and witnesses are saying the fire may have been sparked by a pyrotechnics show. NBC's Mike Taibbi reports.The main door of the nightclub was locked at the time, fire chief Guido Pedroso de Melo told O Globo.He added that firefighters responding to the blaze initially had trouble getting inside the nightclub because "there was a barrier of bodies blocking the entrance.”Survivors and the police inspector Marcelo Arigony said security guards briefly tried to block people from exiting the club, according to the AP, perhaps fearing that patrons would leave without paying their tab.But Arigony said the guards didn't appear to block fleeing patrons for long. "It was chaotic and it doesn't seem to have been done in bad faith because several security guards also died," he told the AP.In a radio interview, the band’s guitarist Rodrigo Martins said the fire began shortly after the band took to the stage at 2.15 a.m. local time Sunday."When the fire started, a guard passed us a fire extinguisher, the singer tried to use it but it wasn't working," he said, adding that the accordion player Danilo Jacques, 28, died, while the five other members made it out safely.Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report. Explore related topics: brazil, fire, nightclub, featured, santa-maria

In the attached Today Show blurb he comments about the 1974 Gulliver's fire in Port Chester, where he "just lived up the hill" from the place.  200 people did not die......only 24.  Quite a difference so don't inflame us with made up facts.2 votes#28 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 12:17 PM ESTCmg-1006452How many more times does this have to happen before people grow a brain and figure out that fireworks (call it whatever you like) DO NOT belong indoors.2 votes#29 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 12:31 PM ESTjohn algarmeA classic example of the herd mentality, these people herded themselves, willingly, into harms way. They couldn't have chosen a more noble cause and place to lose their useless lives. Party hardy you fools !#30 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 12:44 PM ESTGeezStringI feel sorry for the families of the dead and wounded - should not have happened.  But you have to think about it this way too.  "Partying" has become a hazard today and there are gonna be losses asscoaited with  it - think drunk drivers.  One of the big problems with these kind of events is that the club owners never considered the safety of their operation before this and for that oversight there is a criminal liability.  When you throw in the fact that the security guards were stopping the exit because they felt people were running out on their tabs - well, there are so many people at fault in this thing that there is plenty of blame to go around.#31 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 12:46 PM ESTantipackerz@yahoo.comMax 108,you hit the nail right on the head!!1 vote#32 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 12:51 PM ESTJon-816This is a prime example as to why banning guns wont stop people from killing each other..  #33 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 12:51 PM ESTJohn O'ConnorThis has happened TOO many times. Locking exits so that people cannot get out quickly in case of a fire is just plain ridiculous. Someone needs to spend a very long time in jail for this. Doors that can only be opened from the inside and are equiped with warming bells when opened have been available for many many years. There is just no excuse for this tradgedy.1 vote#34 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 12:56 PM ESTRocknRoll SurvivaThere is absolutely NO REASON why this @!$%# is still happening!!  I guess no one learned from the Station Night Club fire, huh?  That's a shame because I was there......one way in and the same way out.  I would have the club immediately.  I guess AT LEAST I learned something from surviving it!!  Well, actually, I learned a lot....but we will leave it at that.#35 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 12:56 PM ESTRocknRoll SurvivaTYPO -  ﻿"I would have LEFT the club immediately."#35.1 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 1:04 PM ESTMichael-1033656Relax, it was just Brazilians. You guys act like it was real people.#35.2 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:28 PM ESTRustic BaboonOnly One Entrance/Exit and Pyrotechnics inside a building, really people what did You think would happen, it doesn't take a rocket scientist, oh and another thing, the security guards blocking the one and only exit
to make sure the patrons pay their bill, disgusting and unacceptable behavior on their part,
even if some of the security guards died, the ones that lived should be facing criminal charges at this point in time, and so should the owner, for only having one entrance/exit, and having the security guards block the exit, this stupidity has to stop, end fireworks inside, I really shouldn't even have to make that statement.1 vote#36 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 1:10 PM ESTLaura-435624never been to brazil but does everything go? any kind of business in any kind of build? no building codes, business licenses, food and alcohol license, fire building codes, locked doors and 100 more legal capacity seems like it was just a matter of time and we say government is too involved makes you think twice doesn't it.#37 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 1:27 PM ESTdon'tlikehypocritesLaura.. I have been to Brazil twice in my life and it is a beautiful country and the people are wonderful. We have many friends there and have had some of them stay with us in the United States. It is different though, you have to be careful where you walk on the streets as you may just fall in a hole in the sidewalk and some of the buildings don't look like they are safe. There are rich and poor and sometimes I wonder if that is the kind of life the tea party wants for America so government stays out of their lives and we just have to take a chance that those bridges we drive over don't collapse.1 vote#37.1 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:00 PM EST

skeptical-1057735What a terrible title to this article!  So insensitive and, well, stupid!  "Shoes, blood and lime slices"??  REALLY??!#38 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 1:27 PM ESTMichael-1033656Pyrotechnics inside a building? It should go without saying that that should not be done. On a more positive note, the accordian player died. Not enough work has been going into getting the worldwide numbers of accordian players down, IMO.#39 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 1:31 PM ESTRodney-1157549We must ban deadly high capacity "assault" clubs like this one so this never happens again!#40 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 1:54 PM ESTGeorge-749102Feinstein is already writing a bill banning flares, nightclubs and loud music. Of course, the Congress is not part of the bill just like the gun control bill she wrote (I guess they are allowed to have clips that hold more than 7/10) and Obamacare. Anyone tired of the bills the Congress votes on that do not apply to them?#41 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 1:57 PM ESTOonaOonaPyrotechnics in an enclosed space. How idiotic.1 vote#42 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 2:13 PM ESTBob KolaHow many more must DIE before these "clubs" are closed down?? The UN needs to send a stern letter to Brazil for allowing this travesty!#43 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 2:26 PM ESTDrBoogieListen:  If you're a band or if you own a venue...put the pyro-technics on the back "burner".  If you're a good band, you don't need them.  If you own a venue, just tell the bands you book "no pyro-technics allowed.
What a tragic loss...all all because some band thought it wasn't good enough without pyro-technics...and some venue owner allowed them to use fireworks INDOORS.1 vote#44 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 2:49 PM ESTAlan-1380274"For the Wages of Sin is DEATH, but the Gift of YAHWEH is Eternal Life through HIS Son YAHSHUA(JESUS Christ)."

The music that those types of bands play reminds me of polka music, and it would seem way out of place to have all that at a polka party. Just seems weird.#49 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:25 PM ESTBupea GiddlefrizzNever been to a tejano bar? Those boys can get down on the squeeze box.1 vote#49.1 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:26 PM ESTThomas90210The same exact circumstances happened in a club in Quezon City, Philippines in 1997. There was one door that served as entrance and exit. More than 100 teen-agers perished int he fire. These were students who were having a ball after graduation. I remember that very sad day.
Why don't we all say a prayer for the families who lost their loved ones. Enough of innuendos and personal attacks. Shame on you!#50 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:42 PM ESTJump to discussion page: 1 2 3Leave a Comment:Name: Email Address (will be verified, but never shown): You're in Easy Mode.

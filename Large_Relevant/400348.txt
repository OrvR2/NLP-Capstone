5daysagoPolice: Brazil nightclub fire kills at least 233A fire broke out early Sunday morning at a night club in Santa Maria, in southern Brazil, killing revelers — many of them students. NBC's Mike Taibbi reports. By Jeff Black, Staff Writer, NBC NewsUpdated at 1:23 a.m. ET: At least 233 people were killed after a band’s fireworks show sparked a rapidly moving fire in a packed nightclub in southern Brazil and fleeing patrons were unable to find their way out, local police said.Follow @NBCNewsWorld
 The bodies removed from the Kiss nightclub in the southern city of Santa Maria were taken to the Municipal Sports Center gymnasium for identification, police said.Major Gerson da Rosa Ferreira, who led rescue efforts at the scene for the military police, told Reuters that the victims died of asphyxiation or from being trampled. Police Maj. Cleberson Braida Bastianello told the Associated Press by telephone that the toll had risen to 233 with the death of a hospitalized victim.

Officials earlier counted 232 bodies that had been brought to the gymnasium in Santa Maria.In addition to the number of deaths, more  than 100 people were injured, police said, and most remain hospitalized. Police officials had reported earlier in the day that 245 people were  killed. The  death toll could still rise, police said later, from the  people who are  injured.Fire brigade colonel Guido Pedroso de Melo told O Globo newspaper that rescuers had difficulty entering the premises because of "a barrier of bodies" at  the entrance to the club.Television footage monitored by Reuters overnight showed people crying outside the club as shirtless firefighters used sledge hammers and axes to knock down an exterior wall to open up an exit. Agencia RBS via APPeople help a man injured in a nightclub fire in Santa Maria city, Brazil, on Sunday.Rodrigo Moura, who the newspaper Diario de Santa Maria identified as a security guard at the club, said it was at its capacity of between 1,000 and 2,000 people and patrons were pushing and shoving to escape, the AP reported. Police estimated the crowd at some 900 revelers.Fire officials said at least one exit was locked and that club bouncers, who at  first thought those fleeing were trying to skip out on bar tabs, initially  blocked patrons from leaving, Reuters reported.The club's management said in a statement it would help authorities with their investigation, Reuters reported.One of the club's owners has surrendered to police for questioning, GloboNews TV reported. "It was really fast. There was a lot of smoke, really dark smoke," survivor Aline Santos Silva, 29, told Globonews TV. "We were only able to get out quickly because we were in a VIP area close to the door." President Dilma Rousseff cut short a visit to Chile and visited families of the victims at the Municipal Sports Center, where relatives were gathering to identify the bodies. She met with relatives of the injured at Hospital de Caridade de Santa Maria.Rousseff declared a national three-day mourning period for victims of the fire. “Sad Sunday!” Tarso Genro, the governor of Rio Grande do Sul state where the club is located, tweeted. “We are taking all of the possible and appropriate actions,” the tweet read, according to a rough translation by NBC News. “I will be in Santa Maria later this morning.”

The precise cause of the fire was still under investigation, authorities said. But Luiza Sousa, a civil police official in Santa Maria, told Reuters that the blaze started when someone with the band ignited what was described as a flare, which then set fire to the ceiling. The fire spread "in seconds," Sousa said. The tragedy in Brazil recalled other nightclub disaster. A fire in West Warwick, Rhode Island, in 2003 killed 100 people after pyrotechnics used on stage by the rock band Great White set ablaze foam used for soundproofing on the walls. A Buenos Aires nightclub blaze in 2004 killed nearly 200 people. Reuters noted that Brazil's safety standards and emergency response capabilities are under particular scrutiny as the country prepares to host the 2014 World Cup soccer tournament and the 2016 Summer Olympics. The Brazilian state’s Health secretary, Ciro Simoni, told the news service that emergency medical supplies from all over the state were being sent to the scene. Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Explore related topics: brazil, fire, nightclub, featured

And yes, if wasn't because a idiot putting fire inside a closed space, 250 people were alived now. I hope laws exist to punish him.
Do you now Brazil? Criminality are very high there,even so the population aren't armed like US. Do you now why? Because they believe in Psalm 121 more than any AR-15. Religion can be teached at schools. Talk to any brazilian, they will say the same, problem there laws are flat, with zero punishement.
No laws can avoid a crime,but if a crime is commited people responsible should be punished.#143 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 1:28 PM ESTJOHNBOY59Damn that's sad.  Sorry to hear it.

I read this comment and I was surprised that some ppl still think Brasil spells with Z... "Tom, the name of the country is Brazil, not Brasil.  If you are going to  insult a people at least get the name of their country right."
I'm from BRASIL, and this is the right way to spell it! Now you can go ahead and insult the lack of safety in Brasil, it's not only in nightclubs, it's everywhere!

The End !!!#165.2 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 2:26 PM ESTKathryn -907827Truly a very very sad and tragic incident.  The capacity was way out of control with just one exit.  No night club should be allowed to be open unless they have several exits.  However, it's unfortunate that even with several exits people panic and smoke disorients people and some would have lost their lives either way.  The human instinct is to flee when there's a fire which is the same thing animals do with no concern for any other thing that's in their way.  Hence lions, elephants, zebras, tigers flee and all stampede together.... the difference is that they have a way to escape....humans normally don't.  My heart goes out to the families that lost a child, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, cousin and a friend.  May you rest in peace.#166 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 2:13 PM ESTgreenfeather1My take on this incident is that Fire is Not A Toy. I went to a 'Burning man" type event a few years ago. It was in the mountains of Pennsylvania. I saw a huge Wicker Man which they set on fire. I saw fire-spinners and a fire-belching engine. What didn't I see? Any fire engines, fire extinguishers or ambulances. Was I the only one who found this disturbing?
This was a fun & memorable event, but I sure would have hated to see it result in a gigantic forest fire that destroyed these beautiful woods. For that reason I say: forget about fire as performance, art or display, and just switch to colored LEDs!! You can do way better effects that will be less likely to result in injury and death.#167 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 2:13 PM ESTEdson Lisboayou pretty right, Nothingwithoutlove we brazilian people are not armed here anymoremost of famlies do not have guns at home cus it is now illegal otherwise the criminals sure have a lot of illegal arms with them by the way we a socialist government here that makes us pay more than billion from taxes each year. The lefstist brazilan government said they took off poverty condition more than 20 million people so that is why miami is full of brazilians expending money buying a lot there!! funny funny very funny But surrealistically we have increased so much the urban violence Brazilians like criminals most users of crack invented a new fashion to assault then rob people here besides stealing shoot them down just for fun now!! So the crimes pools show são paulo, rio de janeiro, bahia so much dangerous place as tijuana, afeganistan or detroit! São paulo the leverage anual homicide is 8 per 100 thousand people, so this increase in rio de janeiro and reaches 60 per 100 thousand people in bahia!So that is the most big lie that guns control diminish the urban violence!! that a political Blah, blah, blah and all that stuff. Brazil is the best example!!#168 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 2:16 PM ESTJump to discussion page: 1 ...  4 5 6 7 8 ...  14Leave a Comment:Name: Email Address (will be verified, but never shown): You're in Easy Mode.

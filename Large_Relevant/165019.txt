Elementary School Teacher Arrested For Alleged Sexual Abuse Of 20 Children, 1 AdultCBS-Losangeles  2:46Officers arrested 57-year-old Robert Pimental, of Newport Beach,  Wednesday after a months-long investigation …






LOS ANGELES (AP) — A fourth-grade teacher who worked for nearly forty years in the Los Angeles Unified School District has been arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing 20 students, a year after another veteran teacher accused of molesting nearly two dozen students brought national attention to the district and the problem of classroom sex abuse.
After a 10-month investigation, eight felony counts of continual sexual abuse and seven counts of lewd acts upon a child were filed Wednesday against Robert Pimentel of Newport Beach for abuse that allegedly took place at George De La Torre Jr. Elementary in the Wilmington area, Officer Christopher No told The Associated Press.
In addition to the 15 felonies, misdemeanor charges are expected for the remaining incidents, No said. Pimentel's bail has been set at $12 million, and an arraignment date hasn't been set.
Police and school officials also said Pimentel is also suspected of the sexual abuse of one adult, but did not say what role if any that person had at the school.
Pimentel, 57, left his fourth-grade teaching position last March when allegations arose from several girls who told their parents he inappropriately touched them during school and police opened an investigation.
District officials immediately removed him from campus and parents and state credentialing authorities were informed, school district spokesman Daryl Strickland said. Parents and guardians will be told of the arrest by letter and phone, he said.
Before the official dismissal process with the Board of Education could begin, Pimentel, who had worked for the district since 1974, retired.
"Can you go back and fire someone who's already retired? No, you can't," LAUSD Superintendent John Deasy told the Los Angeles Times.
Deasy said the school's principal was also immediately removed because the superintendent was "dissatisfied" with how the incident was handled.
Court records obtained by the Times show the allegations covered a period between Sept. 2011 to March 2012.
LAPD Capt. Fabian Lizzaraga told the newspaper Pimentel is suspected of inappropriately touching the children over and under their clothing.
The Los Angeles teachers' union issued a statement calling the incidents described in the allegations "horrific" and saying that Pimentel was no longer a member and the union would not be involved in his defense.
The Police Department said the teacher's name was spelled "Pimental," but the school district and public records give the spelling as "Pimentel."
Police did not know if he had hired an attorney. A woman who picked up the phone at a number listed for Pimentel hung up when asked about a lawyer or comment from family.
There have been several high-profile recent cases of Los Angeles teachers accused of sexually abusing students. More than 225 parents and students are involved in various claims for damages against the district after Miramonte Elementary School teacher Mark Berndt was arrested a year ago and has pleaded not guilty to 23 counts of lewd conduct.
In December, a jury ordered the district to pay a boy molested by an elementary school teacher $6.9 million — among the largest awards in the history of the school system.
The jury found the district liable for the repeated molestation of the 10-year-old student in 2008 and 2009 by teacher Forrest Stobbe at Queen Anne Elementary School in the city's mid-Wilshire district.

Step 1 - Know your children, and teach them what kind of "touching" is not acceptable.

Step 2 - Know your children's teachers, and be active in your child's education.

This may not be the solution to end the molestation of children by teachers, but it's a good place to start.

I think a huge key is parental involvement. Home schooling is not a solution for everyone, especially when the majority of children who are abused/kidnapped/killed are preyed upon by family members & close friends of the family. I was ALWAYS involved in my son's schools. I was a room mother, library volunteer & chaperoned field trips. It was appalling how many times I heard a parent tell the teacher, the principal, or even one of the volunteers, "when he/she is at school, he/she is YOUR responsibility. Don't call me at work, don't call me at home." It happens MUCH more often than people want to admit. Kids with these types of parents are especially vulnerable.  If  school discourages parental involvement, that should be a red flag as well. We were lucky in that our neighborhood schools encouraged both moms & dads to be active in the PTA, as room parents & other volunteer activities.

After abusing kids for 40 years he was allowed to retire?  BULL SHEITE.

He should have been put on administrative leave without pay pending termination and not allowed to simply retire which preserves his pension and benefits...

Today there are few places that are safe for our children.  Sexual abuse is everywhere you turn...the church, the schools and even the "family".  I know.....I am one of the "family" survivors and proud of it.  But it is a scary world out there.

After 40 years of abusing students, I guarantee you, other teachers knew about it and said nothing...

I know there is a shortage of teachers in all areas.  But, the safety of children must be the first consideration.  School administrators have the obligation to protect children from potential perverts.  So, there must be more extensive background and character checks conducted on all new hires, candidates for teaching credentials and tenure candidates.  Careful scruitiny must be maintained thereafter and ALL allegations thoroughly investigated.

A teacher for 40 years, now retired, only now discover he was doing something he oughtn't?  There's some administrators need to be sued for malpractice.

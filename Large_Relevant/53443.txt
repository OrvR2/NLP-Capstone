Hey. Instead of being so MAD, so Furious..try grow a little Love inside. You cannot defeat what you so intensely hate, by hating back..the﻿ only solution is Love, there is no other way.

any normal person would act like this due to the simple fact of finding out that our precious water is purposely poisoned and given to us.. And flouride in water is just a single branch of a corrupt government tree. If somebody were to discover the truth to every single branch in the tree I think their fucking head﻿ would explode.

Ok, I thought I'd heard a lot of crazy... but did he seriously just rail against Child Protective Services?! The insular, paranoid world this man lives in﻿ must be a scary place when he thinks children growing up with abusive parents is better than any sort of government intervention.

As funny as he is there's more than a grain of truth to what he's saying. I'm English and most Europeans consider 9/11 to be an inside job. The Bush Family, Dick Cheney and the Bin Laden's are major shareholder's in the Carlyle Group (a weapons firm) should say it all. Also, members Bin Laden's family were flown out of the U.S. 2 days after 9/11 at the behest of the Bush's. We Europeans can't believe﻿ how you've let them get away with mass murder.

I think that is because most Europeans are not as informed about the events that lead up to 9/11 and the war in Iraq. Most people overseas still think the war was about oil. We produce our own oil, we are supposed to be the biggest oil producer in the world in 2013 according to BP. Our biggest foreign oil imports come from Canada and Latin America because it's much cheaper than shipping oil from overseas. We spent over billion on Iraqi oil during war there, iraq﻿ made lot money off the war.

The only reason﻿ people look at you is because you get angry and are entertainingly stupid.
It's like watching a monkey riding a bicycle, means nothing to the monkey, but we find it adorable.

I know it's difficult to actually hear what he's saying sometimes, but had I not done my own research I wouldn't﻿ know that he is in fact correct more often than not.
The CPS thing he mentions at the end is one of the worst abuses of children this government and its agencies has perpetuated. Senator Nancy Schaefer dedicated herself to stopping this. You should research what happened to her.

I laughed so hard I thought I'd pass out or have a stroke! But I really like Alex a lot and share his videos with other people. He sounds like someone trying to wake up the dead! We are in serious trouble as a nation and the dangers cannot be over exaggerated. His fury is﻿ a reflection of his ability to grasp the horrible nature of evil and
tyranny headed our way. Tyranny is not something you wink at, play with or joke about.
Tyranny is a preview of hell on earth and you all better know it!

and my research into the nature of reality says that the reason knowledge is power is because their are spiritual laws that govern things here, related to consciousness and willingness to seek the truth... and ultimately, an awareness of an intelligent design here (research DNA complexity--walter veith-- or the canon of 400) and God. To me, this is the real reason most of these events do not suffer scrutiny--we are meant to see the shenanigans and realize a﻿ bigger picture than the material... :)

And this is why you can never compare right v left like saying "Oh﻿ TYT are just like Alex Jones". No, they are different. Do both question conventional wisdom? Yes. Do both not take everything the govt says at face value & have disdain for the mainstream media? Yes.
However, when Cenk goes off on a rant, you'll find sources for everything he says from respectable news sources, whereas Alex Jones you need to look for sources that go back to...? Alex Jones.
Alex Jones is a true conspiratorialist

Actually, an attempted coup did occur young man.﻿ Look up "Smedley Butler". Unfortunately, the republic didn't resolve it properly the first time so they have grown exponentially stronger. Lucifarians.

The closest this country has ever come to a Coup d'état would be with the activities of the Knights of the Golden Circle, and the Lincoln Assassination. That of course could be argued. Everything else is B.S. Very much including Mr. Butler﻿ and "The Business Plot"... But Youtube Scholars will believe anything.

The same shit the "outsider" Barrack﻿ Obama was suppose to "CHANGE". As a former supporter of the president in 2008, I can say without a doubt, Barrack Obama if a fucking liar and a total insider

I think you may be confusing the﻿ term "close minded" with the word "naive". If I start a movement about unicorns plotting to conquer the world based on faulty evidence over the next ten years of my life, chances are I'll get at least a handful of followers. Those people shouldn't be deemed "open minded", they should be considered morons. See the difference?

No theres a difference﻿ between being passionate and being a raving fucking lunatic. Its easy to make reasonable points without resorting to this behaviour this is just done for media attention and to get views. It aslo has the dual effect of driving away anyone that leans towards centre and only appealing to an extremist crowd.
TL DR: ITs stupid and childish behaviour that cant be justified in an adult

I like the guy and yes he has stuck his neck out! I have seen him slowly loose it over the years and wonder if he should stop all this for his own health. I think he has done enough to raise awareness﻿ and should let the rest of us take over in the fight against tyranny. It's not just America it's everywhere, when will people like Mr Jones be able to look outside the box?

Obumma droning people, for example, or sugar... or hammers... have you bothered to youtube sandyhook or 911 and see that maybe this crap is contrived by﻿ people who will kill thousands to get their agenda? this is history 101 and the 2nd amendment is 2nd for a reason... soon our liberal free-thinking asses will not be so free if we don't draw the line. tired of lone nuts? research mkultra. knowledge is power, bro.

You're so right my friend, & the saddest thing is that most ppl have no idea that a Communist is now President, that the ultimate goal is massive pop reduction so a Communist World Gov't WITH facist overlays can control the remaining sheep like I am controlling these﻿ keys, FEMA Camps, D.U.M.B.S for the elite, a future that makes Nazi Germany look like playtime, and WORST of all - everything is public information should ppl CHOOSE to go look it up. It's in most of the elites own writings.

"Our liberal free-thinking asses will not be so free'? Well said! The enemy is coming and﻿ attacking us like a hell storm! The party is over and it;s time to sober up. The serious nature of evil and tyranny will be so manifest
there will be no remedy except annihilation. You don't play around with this monster anymore than you can play pitch and toss with the devil in hell!
The stakes for freedom are high and have been based on lofty Christian principles which should never have been abandoned.

Alex Jones is intentionally trying to incite violence. There are peaceful solutions he could implement tomorrow. He could tell EVERY one of his listeners to call up their local sheriff and support him - join the posse... but he won't do it. He could tell all his listeners to start up local meetups and be witnesses at each other's court hearings. There are peaceful solutions but he doesn't want peace.﻿ The PTB always wants war. Stratfor makes a KILLING during wartime. He's a Stratfor shill.

Alex Jones is nuts. I just read that he's trying to blame the Colorado shootings on Obama because he's﻿ trying to 'take away our guns'..that's just freaking insane. Jones is insane. That's quite a leap to jump to that conclusion.

You're getting your﻿ 'evidence' from a film, can you not see how absurd that is? And you make out that Obama is ordering the killing of children, they're collateral damage. They are aiming for terrorists, and have gotten it wrong a number of times. That doesn't make it right, but that is what is happening. You try to give the impression that Obama has ordered the drones to kill the children. Dark Knight is a film, nothing more.

Explain to me why it says Snandy Hook on a map, right when the dude put his finger on it he said take it down. I didn't believe it myself till i went out bought the dvd then when the scene came it was there. Explain that. Also i don't get my facts or evidence from movies, it's in articals, new papers. Not in the mainstream news though. Go look up obama and all the drone stricks he did. People with his power﻿ and him don't care about us, they don't have the same morals has us. There power hungery.

Science cant answer everything and isen't the answer for everything. Evil is﻿ what was done in crimes such as murder, rape, and so on. Science isen't suppose to be the answer for things like this, just because theres no proof or evidence doesn't mean it isen't real

I´m sorry but, precisely, the main requirement to tell that something is real or not is the evidence. Quantum theory, game theory, evolution theory, cellular theory, every scientific theory was made by the study of evidence. If it does not have evidence, then it is a lie. And if you think that that´s﻿ not true, let me tell you something, the very computer you use to write all your bullshit was constructed by the study of evidence, not by inferior monkeys like Alex Nutjones.

When I was in college I was an intern for AJ. He used to make me throw sliders directly into his mouth during commercial breaks. He'd put down 8 or 9 burgers at a time. That man cuts farts that could kill bears. He had this copy of the Declaration of Independence behind his desk and every time he farts it would roll up and fall off the wall. It﻿ was my job to hang it back up. I'd put it back on the wall 5 or 6 times a day. He thought that was funniest thing. He was kind of a jerk.

Who exactly,﻿ is he fuckin ranting at? Does he think Wall St bankers and politicians are listening to his rant, or is this just an attempt to get some psycho listeners all fired up to go and commit some stupid acts? This guy is so fake.

If﻿ you redneck fuckwits really value your right to bear arms, I call on you to actually use those fucking weapons for stuff besides rubbing your cocks up against them, making up fantasies of the day you'll get to RISE UP!!! If the situation is as shitty right now as you right wingers seem to think, why have you not charged the white house? Pansy ass gun fetishist sissies.

Hey hey hey, it's a member of the Cult of Alex Jones. Have you done your daily blood ritual to combat these imaginary menaces to society? Alex Jones is a fraud who makes countless wrong predictions, and has a bad habit of lying. He's also a notorious jackass, a prime example of that being at a﻿ gun rights rally in Dallas (I think it was in 2009) where he came there and started shouting over everyone else with his megaphone and putting down other people.

Pretty sure Alex Jones turns his life﻿ in to this crazy drama of conspiracy, power struggles, and world domination plots so that he can blame the government and bankers for all his problems and not face the reality that he's not a brave revolutionary, just an insane blubbering dumbass with a boring radio show.

Why does Jones say, you know what it's like to go to sleep at﻿ night knowing you work for pyschotic killers, that will probably kill him one day? Ok that's fine, I've watched alex for over a year and I understand his passion and that he truly believes in his cause, I respect that, if not the way he comes cross. I understand there are those that want to kill him.
So is this statement of his an admission to him being a shill or what am I supposed to think?

I rethought the whole statement and I think I understand now what jones is saying. He works for psychotic killers because taxpayers like him fund the﻿ crony government schemes and whatever programs they siphon money to, which then affects the whole picture.

It's wrong if it is IN FACT dangerous which you have not demonstrated in any way. Babies are more susceptible to fluorosis which is the only problem I have with fluoridation, but to say there is a NWO that's intentionally doing it and fluoridation is ploy to poison﻿ people is just retarded. Conspiracy theorists always resort to cheap tactics like this instead of using actual argument. Can we just agree to disagree? It's tiresome to repeat the same argument to someone who go "lalalala",

Did you just disregard my point﻿ a, b, and c and decide to go to the "you are evil if you don't agree with me" and the "appeal to emotion instead of using evidence" route? Yep, talking to conspiracy theorists are a waste of time.

a) My opinion is that there should be more studies on fluoridation, but so far evidences show it poses no long term health risks beside fluorosis.
b) At 0.5mg/L concentration, fluoride is not a toxin. Anything is a toxin at the correct concentration.
c) To call it evil would assume there is a NWO and that fluoridation is toxic at 0.5mg/L. There is evidence for neither, so no it's not evil in the sense there is no NWO (but yo9u will﻿ disagree on that).
And yes let's just agree to disagree.

Most of the fluoride in the body is expelled. There is no mental effect at 0.5mg/L over a period of time. The rest are absorbed into the bone and teeth and calcium riched area, not the brain. They are not in the blood stream after they are absorbed.﻿
The MSDS, as I REPEATEDLY said, uses concentrations higher than 0.5 mg/L and is NOT applicable to fluoridation.

It seems no matter how much I talk to you, you keep confusing 0.5mg/L over a long period of time vs higher concentration in shorter period of time.
"they still want to mass medicate", "use our babies as toxin filters﻿ to avoid specialised waste costs." wild conjectures that's based on faulty evidence. Do you just want to call it a day and agree to disagree?

No you haven't. I ask can you prove fluoridation at 0.5mg/L poses significant health risks.
- You link me to MSDS that has absolutely no bearing on fluoridation because it's not talking about concentrations of 0.5mg/L.
- You said we accumulate 657mg of fluoride from fluoridation per year which can cause illness that kill people, yet your﻿ math is completely wrong and there has been no cases of people dying from fluoridation.

I think it's Chemical Hazard Information Profile. I'm﻿ not so sure it has anything to do with fluoridation, so I don't see your point besides they don't have a profile on fluoride. Any chemical is going to be toxic at high level. The question is at 0.5mg/L, will fluoride cause significant health problems? So far the only connection is fluorosis and possibly osteosclerosis, which is not even close to deadly.

"The flaw is the original consensus of the study." Can you provide any reason why the original consensus is wrong? They put forth the data. They did a systemic study. It was peer reviewed by other scientists. I fail to see how﻿ you found a flaw.
I would also like to point out, I'm not saying fluoridation is necessary or completely safe (fluorosis), I'm objecting to conspiracy theorists' claim that fluoridation is highly toxic and it's a part of NWO's plan.

Do﻿ you actually an argument, or are you going to engage in ad hominem attack? I've refuted everyone of your argument so far. You claim it's a poison, I've refuted your argument. You said fluoridation kills people (657mg), yet so far you've fail to present a single case of it happening. In fact you've been skirting around the 0.5mg/L fluoride level and never addressed the actual topic.

On﻿ the same page it also said it's not a classifiable as human carcinogen. You also have to realize it does not contain to any dosage/concentration. Even table salt kills you if you eat too much of it.

You also convenient miss out the fact 0.5mg/L of fluoridation has not been shown to trigger any health effect describe above (beside fluorosis and possibly slight osteosclerosis). "Repeated or prolonged skin contact may produce pustular rash." Yeah so if I put my hand in tap water I will get a rash? Pretty obvious they are not talking about﻿ 0.5mg/L here.
"May cause cancer based on animal test data. No human data found." Notice the "may"? Notice "no human data found"?

You do realize
- fluoride is quite soluble and the body excrete most of it?
- you get﻿ fluoride from sources other then water fluoridation?
- the recommended level is actually around 0.5 to 1 mg/L of water and 1.5 is the MAXIMUM tolerated amount?
- there has not been a case of death due to fluoridation?
- salt is highly toxic too and we eat 2g of it per day? Ever heard of dosage?
Fearmongering is not going to get you anywhere, especially when your argument is this ridiculous.

health risks beside possible fluorosis and MAYBE (very slightly) increase bone fracture risks. Fluoridation has not been shown to HAVE ANY effect﻿ of the brain .
I am very curious how you and many conspiracy theorists go from "fluoridation MAY cause minor health problems that does not affect the brain" to "therefore the government did it on purpose and there must be a plot to poison the general population and NWO exists". Please do tell how you go from the premise to the conclusion.

"The research is totally proved."﻿ Says who? As far as I'm aware the scientific community agree fluoridation cause no health issue. A lot of "fluoride truth" websites deliberate misrepresent facts to make it sound scary. While it's controversial I would say it's hardly "totally proved".

At 0:32 when he said "I know they are carrying out new﻿ world order), he touch his nose, a pretty classic sign of deceit. He's obviously acting, can't believe people listen to him. This is stupid.

So, anyone who touches their nose while talking is lying - man that is stupid and just a bit gay. Sometimes a bit of dry skin, particle﻿ or loose hair can cause a little itch that needs to be wiped away so it doesn't distract, but I guess your paranoid little brain couldn't figure that.

Given Alex Jones' history of lying, and making predictions that never come true, and the fact he has absolutely no evidence for anything he said, he's either a complete paranoid lunatic who actually believes what he said or this is just an act to get money. Given that body language and the exaggerated outrage I'll go with the latter, unless you actually believe Alex Jones, in which case﻿ I have nothing to say to you because your argument will be "open your eyes". And I'm paranoid? LOL

20 pages of information debunking the whole film. Alex Jones thrives on unsubstantiated and exaggerated claims﻿ (i.e. lies), which he used constantly in the films.

Fluoride -> no mind control power, it MAY BE harmful (unlikely), and it doesn't prove anything about NWO
GMO -> no proof it poisons us except wild unsubstantiated claims
Bohemian -> I just gave someone a website that page by page debunks﻿ the Alex Jone's movie
Subliminal -> No experiment has ever shown subliminal message can influence the mind, and all the so call "messages" are images that can show up anywhere.
I fail to see how any of those can prove anything about NWO.

Please provide concrete scientific studies that show trace amount of fluoride in water (0.5milligrams/L of water) is harmful. Or do you just believe conspiracy theories website that has done absolutely no study on the subject and routinely uses unsubstantiated claims (i.e. lies)? Just﻿ an advice, it's a good idea to actually do some research before believing stuff on the internet.

Every hardcore Alex Jones supporter must watch this clip and look me in the eyes and say this is a behaviour of a normal person. Or watch his Joker clips. Or the one where he makes chimpanzee impersonation. Or hundred others.
Yes i﻿ know, he is just passioned about the truth, right??
Well, that may be so but to me he looks like a mad man.
Seen like 100 clips on youtube and more i watch him more i see he is mentaly unstable.
He is right about several things but NOT EVERYTHING IS A CONSPIRACY !!!

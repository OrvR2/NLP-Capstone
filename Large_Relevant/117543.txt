A government lawyer’s attempt to get dismissed nearly $700 in traffic tickets given to the U.S. Postal Service is being met with a hearty and humorous, Heck no.
In a Jan. 22 letter sent to both the city of East Cleveland, Ohio, and the company that operates the city's photo-enforcement program, Postal Service attorney Jennifer S. Breslin says two school-zone speeding citations and five red-light infractions by postal trucks in December should be ignored.
“In providing mail service across the country, the Postal Service attempts to work within local and state laws and regulations, when feasible,” wrote Breslin, after reminding “To Whom It May Concern” that postal workers promptly deliver over 200 billion pieces of mail annually.
“However, as you are probably aware, the Postal Service enjoys federal immunity from state and local regulation,” she continued.
That last bit did not go over well with American Traffic Solutions (ATS), the Arizona-based company

Underground dentist not remorseful about illegal practiceBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – 17 hrs agoTweet0

 PLANO, Texas—Inside the unassuming ranch-style house, investigators discovered things like an x-ray machine, grinders, syringes, surgical instruments and anesthetics.
Police say the homeowner, 63-year-old Jose Santiago Delao, had been running an underground dental clinic in the aging suburban Dallas neighborhood for years: pulling teeth and filling cavities, among other procedures.
As shocking as this sounds, Delao's case is not that unusual. And it offers insight into a world of backyard dentistry that caters to those in the country illegally, the uninsured and others who can’t find affordable dental care.
Delao admits he skirted the law, but isn’t remorseful. “Jesus Christ didn’t need or didn’t have a license,” Jose Delao told Yahoo News during a jailhouse interview. “People hurt and they needed it. People didn’t have enough money to visit the regular dentist.”

Shooting victim’s emotional return to Aurora movie theaterBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Fri, Jan 18, 2013Tweet0

The Aurora, Colo., theater billed it as a night of “remembrance and reopening,” but did Marcus Weaver really want to reconcile with the place where he was shot and his friend killed six months ago? Even his therapist was unsure if he could handle it.
“In some ways I feel like I need to take a stand, but it might be painful, too,” Weaver, 42, told Yahoo News.
Not surprisingly, his emotions yo-yoed in the hours before Thursday night’s event. “I am up and down, a wreck,” he wrote on Facebook. “But truly feel I need to go on so many levels that I can't even explain.”
And so he did. Wearing a T-shirt bearing the name and image of his friend Rebecca Wingo, Weaver went back to the Century theater where Wingo and 11 others were killed when suspected gunman James Holmes opened fire during a midnight showing of the Batman movie, "The Dark Knight Rises." Fifty-eight others, including Weaver, were wounded by gunfire.
Weaver chronicled his return in emails to Yahoo News:

Emotions boil in Colorado as accused theater shooter’s arraignment is delayedBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Fri, Jan 11, 2013Tweet0

(AP Photo)Steve Hernandez, father of Rebecca Wingo, was sitting among other victims and family members in the packed courtroom. Many of them were visibly upset that Judge William Sylvester had just postponed an arraignment scheduled for Friday until March 12.
Hernandez was detained by three sheriff's deputies while the judge met privately outside the courtroom with Holmes' defense attorneys and prosecutors.
When the judge re-entered the courtroom, Hernandez publicly identified himself as the father of the late 32-year-old Wingo.
"I'm terribly sorry for your loss and can't even begin to imagine the emotions that are raging," Sylvester said from the bench.
Hernandez told the judge he meant no disrespect for him or the court.
"I promise there will be no further outbursts,"

CENTENNIAL, Colo.— James Holmes’ two-door hatchback was full of items indicating he might have planned to flee after allegedly shooting up an Aurora, Colo., movie theater in July.
Tire-puncturing devices, a canister of tear gas, a .40-caliber handgun, ammunition, Holmes' iPhone and various backpacks were found in the car, police testified this week.
“I do think he was thinking that he was going to get away from that movie theater,” Mary Ellen O’Toole, a former FBI profiler not associated with the case, told Yahoo News.
Prosecutors painted a picture this week of how and where Holmes allegedly executed his horrific attack. What they didn’t explain is why, or if, the suspected mastermind had plans to flee after shooting 70 moviegoers, 12 of them fatally.
Testimony from the officer who handcuffed the suspect said Holmes, clad in SWAT gear, gave up without a fight behind the movie theater moments after the massacre.
But another officer, Aurora Sgt.

CENTENNIAL, Colo.— Photos recovered from James Holmes’ iPhone show the alleged gunman posing with weapons and making creepy faces in the weeks and hours before the shooting massacre at an Aurora movie theater.
The images were not released to the public, but were shown in court Wednesday during Holmes' preliminary hearing.
It was the state's final move before declaring that it had presented overwhelming evidence that Holmes meticulously planned and executed the attack without remorse.
"Because he wanted to kill all of them, and he knew what he was doing," prosecutor Karen Pearson said in arguing that the case should go to trial.
One of the more disturbing self-portraits was snapped on July 12. It shows his infamous orange-dyed hair flaring out from beneath a black skull cap. His eye color is darkened by black contact lenses, and he is grinning with his tongue sticking out.
Three other self-portraits were snapped approximately six hours before the

CENTENNIAL, Colo. - At times late Tuesday afternoon, Sgt. Fyles had to pause to compose himself while on the stand confirming the names and injuries of all 83 people killed, shot or injured by suspected gunman James Holmes' actions.
Fyles seemed particularly poignant on the names where he had more personal knowledge.
"He can't move his arms or legs," Fyles said of a man who is permanently paralyzed.
After helping prosecutors enter the names of the injured, prosecutors asked him to verify the names of the deceased.
Family members of Rebecca Wingo, a 32-year-old mother of two, sobbed as her name and the criminal charges associated with her death were read aloud.
Holmes faces a total of 166 criminal counts. Where warranted, the state of Colorado allows dual charges (premeditated and without remorse) for murder and

CENTENNIAL, Colo.— Half of the people killed inside the movie theater suffered multiple gunshot wounds, two Arapahoe County coroners testified on Monday.
Their wounds came from the assault-style rifle, shotgun and pistol prosecutors allege James Holmes carried with him during the rampage.
Some of the people who survived the attack were burned by two canisters of tear gas police said Holmes tossed into the crowd.
Detective Todd Fredericksen testified that he had the tough task of interviewing many of the injured in the days and weeks after the shooting.
One victim told investigators it seemed the shooter was, "targeting people who were fleeing," Fredericksen told the courtroom.
Tuesday's testimony resumes at 9:30 a.m. Mountain time.

DENVER -- As a God-fearing man, Marcus Weaver tries to accept that alleged movie theater gunman James Holmes deserves his day in court.
“But he could do us all a favor and just plead guilty,” said Weaver, one of at least 70 people injured in last July’s ambush in Aurora, Colo. Twelve people were killed when the shooter opened fire during a during a midnight showing of the Batman movie, "The Dark Knight Rises."
Weaver, 42, was in the fifth row of the dark theater when the heavily-armed assailant burst in and began firing. Weaver’s right shoulder was peppered with gunshot pellets. Rebecca Wingo, one his best friends, died in the attack.
“It’s tough, it’s tough, it’s tough,” he said with a sigh. “The noises, the sounds, it all comes back.”
Weaver is dreading the coming week when never-before-disclosed details of the case against Holmes will be made public at a long-awaited preliminary hearing.

Former Boy Scout safety director freed from federal prisonBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Thu, Jan 3, 2013Tweet0

DALLAS - The Boy Scouts of America have banned thousands of pedophiles and other undesirables from working as volunteers.
But one name on their rejection list stands out: Douglas Sovereign Smith Jr. The BSA’s former national director for youth protection was released from prison last week after serving nearly seven years behind bars.
He was in charge of Scout safety programs in 2005 when police discovered hundreds of images of child pornography and videos on his home computer. Some included prepubescent boys exposing themselves and engaging in sexual acts.
“Heart-wrenching and gut-tearing,” a prosecutor said at the time.
Smith reenters public life at a time when the Scouts are being heavily scrutinized for their past handling of alleged child sex abuse at the hands of staff and troop leaders.
None of Smith’s 520 photos were of Scouts and he was never accused of molesting children, but his case is a disturbing reminder that people in positions of power can lead double lives that put

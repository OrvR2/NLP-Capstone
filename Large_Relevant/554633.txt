	                     The nightclub fire that claimed more than 230 lives in the Brazilian city of Santa Maria may have been caused by cheap flares used there by a band and "diverse irregularities" in the club itself, according to the police. The revelation came as the Rio Grande do Sul state forensics department raised the death toll from 231 to 234 to account for three victims who did not appear on the original list of the dead. "The flare lit was for outdoor use only, and the people who lit them know that," Marcelo Arigony, police inspector, said, adding that members of the group acknowledged regularly opting for the less expensive...

Brazil nightclub fire kills 245 people - Santa Maria's Tragedy


                    Last updated 28/01/2013 A fire swept through a crowded nightclub in southern Brazil early Sunday, killing at least 245 people and leaving at least 200 injured, police and firefighters said. Police Maj. Cleberson Braida told local news media that the 245 bodies were brought for identification to a gymnasium in the city of Santa Maria. That toll would make it one of the deadliest nightclub fires more than a decade. The cause of the fire is not yet known, officials said.Officials earlier put the death toll at 180. Civil Police and regional government spokesman Marcelo Arigoni told Radio Gaucha earlier that the total number of victims is still unclear and there may be hundreds injured. The newspaper Diario de Santa Maria reported that the fire started at around 2 am at the Kiss nightclub in the city at the southern tip of Brazil, near the borders with Argentina and Uruguay. Rodrigo Moura, whom the paper identified as a security guard at the club, said it was at its maximum capacity of between 1000 and 2000, and partygoers were pushing and shoving to escape. Ezekiel Corte Real, 23, was said by the paper as saying that he helped people to escape. '''I just got out because I'm very strong,'' he said. '''Sad Sunday'', tweeted Tarso Genro, the governor of the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul. He said all possible action was being taken and that he would be in the city later in the day. Santa Maria is a major university city with a population of around a quarter of a million ...

Three arrested over Brazil nightclub fire


                    Following the devastating nightclub fire that left 231 people dead in Brazil. A police spokesperson has announced the arrest of 3 people, with a fourth person,believed to be the co owner wanted in connection with the fire at the Kiss nightclub in Santa Maria. These include the night club owner, who is reported to have confirmed its fire safety certificate had expired last year. A member of the band who allegedly fired a flare during the performance which sparked the fire ,and its security chief who are all being questioned by Police. Associated Press reported how survivors said security guards briefly tried to block people from leaving the club. As in Brazil, bar owners make customers pay their whole tab at the end of an evening, before they are allowed to leave. Officials are also investigating claims that many of those who died were unable to escape as only one emergency exit was available, as the others weren't working. But eye witnesses are saying that it seems most of the people died of the toxic smoke, and not the fire. Although full investigations will reveal the exact cause and its deadly impact shortly.

                    NEW FOOTAGE Nightclub FIRE (Fireworks) Tragedy in Brazil Kills 233 people - Santa Maria's Tragedy 2013 HD 720dpi Brazil has declared three days of national mourning for 233 people killed in a nightclub fire in the southern city of Santa Maria. The fire reportedly started after a member of a band playing at the Kiss nightclub lit a flare on stage. Authorities say most of the victims were students who died of smoke inhalation. The first funerals are expected on Monday morning. It is the deadliest fire in Brazil in five decades. The BBC's Gary Duffy reports from Sao Paulo that the national sense of loss is profound. 'Dark, heavy smoke' The fire broke out as students from the city's federal university (UFSM) were holding a freshers' ball, the Diario de Santa Maria, a local newspaper, reported. A local journalist, Marcelo Gonzatto, told the BBC that the flare had "started a huge and fast fire that grew quickly and made a very dark and heavy smoke." Witnesses spoke of scenes of panic after the fire started, and a stampede as people tried to escape. One, Mattheus Bortolotto, told local television: "It was sheer horror. The emergency exits did not work, and then I lost my friend in the confusion. Then a girl died in my arms. I felt her heart stop beating." A large number of victims were trapped in the club's toilets, they said, possibly after mistaking them for an exit. Survivors and police inspector Marcelo Arigony said security guards briefly tried to block people from leaving ...

Last updated 28/01/2013 A fire swept through a crowded nightclub in southern Brazil early Sunday, killing at least 245 people and leaving at least 200 injured, police and firefighters said. Police Maj. Cleberson Braida told local news media that the 245 bodies were brought for identification to a gymnasium in the city of Santa Maria. That toll would make it one of the deadliest nightclub fires more than a decade. The cause of the fire is not yet known, officials said.Officials earlier put the death toll at 180. Civil Police and regional government spokesman Marcelo Arigoni told Radio Gaucha earlier that the total number of victims is still unclear and there may be hundreds injured. The newspaper Diario de Santa Maria reported that the fire started at around 2 am at the Kiss nightclub in the city at the southern tip of Brazil, near the borders with Argentina and Uruguay. Rodrigo Moura, whom the paper identified as a security guard at the club, said it was at its maximum capacity of between 1000 and 2000, and partygoers were pushing and shoving to escape. Ezekiel Corte Real, 23, was said by the paper as saying that he helped people to escape. '''I just got out because I'm very strong,'' he said. '''Sad Sunday'', tweeted Tarso Genro, the governor of the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul. He said all possible action was being taken and that he would be in the city later in the day. Santa Maria is a major university city with a population of around a quarter of a million ...

Following the devastating nightclub fire that left 231 people dead in Brazil. A police spokesperson has announced the arrest of 3 people, with a fourth person,believed to be the co owner wanted in connection with the fire at the Kiss nightclub in Santa Maria. These include the night club owner, who is reported to have confirmed its fire safety certificate had expired last year. A member of the band who allegedly fired a flare during the performance which sparked the fire ,and its security chief who are all being questioned by Police. Associated Press reported how survivors said security guards briefly tried to block people from leaving the club. As in Brazil, bar owners make customers pay their whole tab at the end of an evening, before they are allowed to leave. Officials are also investigating claims that many of those who died were unable to escape as only one emergency exit was available, as the others weren't working. But eye witnesses are saying that it seems most of the people died of the toxic smoke, and not the fire. Although full investigations will reveal the exact cause and its deadly impact shortly.

NEW FOOTAGE Nightclub FIRE (Fireworks) Tragedy in Brazil Kills 233 people - Santa Maria's Tragedy 2013 HD 720dpi Brazil has declared three days of national mourning for 233 people killed in a nightclub fire in the southern city of Santa Maria. The fire reportedly started after a member of a band playing at the Kiss nightclub lit a flare on stage. Authorities say most of the victims were students who died of smoke inhalation. The first funerals are expected on Monday morning. It is the deadliest fire in Brazil in five decades. The BBC's Gary Duffy reports from Sao Paulo that the national sense of loss is profound. 'Dark, heavy smoke' The fire broke out as students from the city's federal university (UFSM) were holding a freshers' ball, the Diario de Santa Maria, a local newspaper, reported. A local journalist, Marcelo Gonzatto, told the BBC that the flare had "started a huge and fast fire that grew quickly and made a very dark and heavy smoke." Witnesses spoke of scenes of panic after the fire started, and a stampede as people tried to escape. One, Mattheus Bortolotto, told local television: "It was sheer horror. The emergency exits did not work, and then I lost my friend in the confusion. Then a girl died in my arms. I felt her heart stop beating." A large number of victims were trapped in the club's toilets, they said, possibly after mistaking them for an exit. Survivors and police inspector Marcelo Arigony said security guards briefly tried to block people from leaving ...

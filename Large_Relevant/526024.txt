WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama turned to law enforcement on Monday for support in his push to tighten gun laws, meeting at the White House with police chiefs from cities scarred by mass shootings and calling for more officers nationwide.
              Obama, who has made stricter gun control measures a top policy goal for this year, reiterated his desire that lawmakers pass measures he recently unveiled to curb gun violence, including an assault weapons ban and universal background checks for gun purchases.
              The meeting was the latest in a series of discussions that Obama is using to try to build political support for tighter gun control after 20 young children and six adults were killed in December by a gunman at a school in Newtown, Connecticut.
              Newtown's police chief, Michael Kehoe, attended the meeting along with his counterparts from Aurora, Colorado, where 12 people were killed and 58 wounded in a mass shooting at a movie theater last July, and from Oak Creek, Wisconsin, where six people were killed and four wounded at a Sikh temple in August.
              In remarks to reporters at the start of the meeting, Obama noted that the police chiefs realized the problem of gun violence extends beyond high-profile mass shootings.
              "That's why part of the conversation that we're going to be having today relates not only to the issue of new laws or better enforcement of our gun laws, it also means what are we doing to make sure that we've got the strongest possible law enforcement teams on the ground?" Obama said.
              "What are we doing to hire more cops? What are we doing to make sure that they're getting the training that they need?" he said.
              Obama wants to ban military-style assault weapons and ensure that all gun buyers are subjected to background checks. But he needs Congress to pass legislation on the politically tricky issues.
              The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold its first hearing on Wednesday on the measures.
              "The only way that we're going to be able to do everything that needs to be done is with the cooperation of Congress," Obama said.
              "That means passing serious laws that restrict the access and availability of assault weapons and magazine clips that aren't necessary for hunters and sportsmen and those responsible gun owners who are out there. It means that we are serious about universal background checks," he said.
              The National Rifle Association, the country's most powerful pro-gun lobby group, has vowed to defeat the plan, which it says would infringe on gun ownership rights protected by the U.S. Constitution.
              Monday's meeting included Vice President Joe Biden, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano.
              Obama and Biden have said their plan would not affect the rights of responsible gun owners. Biden traveled to Richmond, Virginia last week with that message.

Curtis: You must know 2 really stupid women if they had abortions just because Democrats and the Supreme Court said they could. I guess I'm not really surprised. About the part of you knowing 2 really stupid women. But I am surprised they did it just because Democrats and the SC said they could. Tell me, did they get pregnant just so they could have (and pay for) abortions, too?

The focus should be on CRIMINAL control, not gun control. Our revolving door justice system allows the dirtbags free reign, while penalizing those of us who are upstanding. Check out the following DOJ stats:
64% of murder victims in New Orleans had past felony arrests
91% of Baltimores murder victims had criminal records
75% of murder victims in Philadelphia had criminal records
77% of murder victims in Milwaukee had an average of 12 arrests 
85% of murder victims in Newark had criminal records
91% of murder victims in Arizona had criminal records
74% of murder victims in San Fransisco had criminal records
75% of murder victims in Indianapolis had criminal records
71% of murder victims in Charlotte had criminal records
60% of murder victims in Atlanta had criminal records

81% of all homicide defendants have at least one arrest on their record.
66% have two or more arrests. 
67% have at least one felony arrest.
56% have two or more felony arrests.
70% have at least one conviction.
54% have at least one felony conviction.

How come if a civilian owns a semi-automatic version of the M-4 the government labels it an "Assault Weapon" but when Homeland Security puts out an RFP for 7000 M-4's capable of fully automatic fire (machine guns) they are referred to as "Personal Defense Weapons" (PDW)?

The creation of jobs lower crime. When people are happy and have a lot to lose they are less likely to commit crimes. When people have nothing to lose crime increases. Simple economics.

From what I have seen on television and heard on the radio Barack Obama is going to lose that arguement. The vast majority do not believe in banning assualt and military weapons out of the nation and neither do I.

I never met a police officer who was in favor of gun control, and I've talked to many.  And the thing is, I didn't ask them.  They just came out and told me!  They think gun control is a crazy idea!
